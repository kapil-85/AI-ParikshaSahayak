FOREWORD

The Punjab School Education Board has been continuously engaged
in developing syllabi, producing and renewing text books according to the
changing educational needs at the state and national level.

This book has been developed in accordance to the guidelines of
National Curriculum Framework (NCF) 2005 and PCF 2013, after careful
deliberations in workshops involving experienced teachers and experts
from the board and field as well. All efforts have been made to make this
book interesting with the help of activities and coloured figures. This book
has been prepared with the joint efforts of subject experts of Board, SCERT
and experienced teachers/experts of mathematics. Board is thankful to all
ofthem.

The authors have tried their best to ensure that the treatment,
presentation and style of the book in hand are in accordance with the mental
level of the students of classs VIII. The topics, contents and examples in the
book have been framed in accordance with the situations existing in the
young learner's environment. A number of activities have been suggested in
every lesson. These may be modified keeping in view the availability of local
resources and real life situations of the learners.

| hope the students will find this book very useful and interesting. The
Board will be graceful for suggestions from the field for further improvement
of the book.

CHAPTER

Rational Numbers

In this chapter you will learn:
* About number system.

+ To apply different operations : Addition, Subtraction, Multiplica-
tion and Division on rational numbers.
¢ About the properties of rational numbers under different operations.

1.1 Introduction

In earlier classes, we have studied about counting numbers or natural numbers ic. 1, 2,
BM soxevrweve . By including 0 to natural numbers, we get whole numbers ie. 0, |, 2, 3, 4.........
The negative of natural numbers and whole numbers, when put together, we get integers i.e.
— 4, 3, 2-1, 0, 1,.2,.3) seve vscees

Fundamental operations i.e. addition, subtraction, multiplication and division were defined on
integers and various properties of these operations were also discussed in previous class, The concept of
rational numbers was introduced and fundamental operations on rational numbers were also discussed. In
this chapter, we shall learn about different properties of these operations on rational numbers.

Let us first recall about rational numbers.
1.2 Rational Numbers:

|
A number of the form or a number which can be expressed in the form iF . where p and

—2 10 —3
q are integers, q # 0 and p, q are co-prime is called a rational number e.g. 3° 7 8? -3, 0
ete.
¢ All natural numbers are rational numbers.
+ All whole numbers are rational numbers.

¢ Allintegers are rational numbers.

1.2.1 Addition of Rational Numbers

In previous class, we have defined the addition of rational numbers. We know if two rational
numbers are to be added, then first we have to express each of them as rational number with same
and positive denominator (by taking LCM), then we solve,

Let us discuss some examples.

Example 1.1 Solve the following:

1.2.2 Properties of Addition of Rational Numbers

In this section, we shall learn some basic properties of rational numbers under addition. These
properties are similar to those of addition of integers which we have learnt in the previous classes.
* Closure Property : The sum of any two rational numbers is always a rational number. e.g. if

a nd &

aie
b q ae any two rational numbers then —+— is also a rational number.

8 4 8 8
Commutative Property : The two rational numbers can be added in any order, the result
will be same, We say that addition is commutative for rational numbers.

Associative Property : When three rational numbers are to be added by adding the first
two rational numbers and then adding the third number in result or by adding the second and
third rational numbers and then adding the first number in the result. We get the same result.
Then we say that the addition of rational numbers is associative.

Additive Identity ; When we add 0 to any rational number we get the same rational num-

ber. i.e, For any rational number + , b #0 there exists a unique rational number 0 such that

a a a
b +0 b =0+ b

then 0 is called the identity for the addition of rational numbers. We say ‘0’ is the additive
identity for rational numbers.

Additive Inverse: When two rational numbers are added and give the result zero (0)(addi-
tive identity) then both rational numbers are called additive inverse of each other.

not hold in subtraction. Because for any rational number a, a— 0 =a but 0—a#a, so in case
of subtraction identity does not exist.

1.4 Multiplication of Rational Numbers:

In earlier classes, we have learnt the multiplication of two fractions, The product of two given
fractions is a fraction whose numerator is the product of the numerators of the given fractions and
whose denominator is the product of the denominators of the given fractions.

ie.
Product of their numerators
Product of their denominators
This same rule is applicable to the product of rational numbers.

Product of their numerators

1.4.1 Properties of Multiplication of Rational Numbers:
In this section, we shall learn some basic properties of nultiplication of rational numbers. These
properties are similar to those of multiplication of integers which we have learnt in previous classes.
* Closure Property : The product of any two rational numbers is always a rational number.
ie,

=

if = and = qa d #0) are any two rational numbers.

b
ac
then ba is also a rational number.

(ii) 9 5 I B 3 8 a rational number.

» Commutative Property : When two rational numbers can be multiplied in any order then
we say that mance is commutative for rational numbers,

* Associatve Property : When three rational numbers are to be multiplied, by multiplying the
first two rational numbers and then multiply the third number or by multiplying the second and third
rational numbers and then multiplying the first number If we get the same result, then we say that the
multiplication of rational numbers is associative.

eg. Consider three rational numbers —— 8°90 and -2 then

a ital (2-5
Bel -&

* Multiplicative Identity : When we multiply 1 by any rational number then the product is
the same rational number.

ie Forany rational number .(b#0) there exists a unique natural number 1 such that Ixt a aie

So 1is the multiplicative Sie for rational numbers.
Multiplicative Inverse: When two rational numbers are multiplied and give result 1 (multi-
plicative identity) then one rational number is called the multiplicative inverse of other i.e. For any

rational umber > — (b #0) there exist — > a #0) such that

2.1 Introduction :-

In class VIL, we have already discussed the concept of an equation in one variable and its solution,

e.g. 4x = 12, 3y = 15, 2y + 1 = 9 ete.

In this section, we shall discuss this concept in detail,

2.2 Equation in one Variable:-
The equation in which algebraic expression have one variable is called equation in one vari-
able. e.g. 2y + 5 =9, 324-1 =7, 4x? + 5x=8 ete.

In above examples, all the equations have one variable.

But 2x + 3y = 7, 2a +b +¢=7, 4abe = 5 etc. are not equations in one variable as

* 1* equation has two variables i.e. x and y

+ 2" equation has three variables i.e. a, b and c.

* 3 equation also has three variables i.e. a, b and c.
2.2.1 Linear Equation in one yariable:-

The equation in one variable having degree (highest power of variable) 1 is called linear equa-

tion in one variable e.g.(i) 2x + 3 = 12 is linear equation in one variable (x).
(i) Sy —3=8 is linear equation in one variable (y).
Gi) ©2x+3=Syis nota linear equation in one variable. Here, we have two variables (x and y)
(iv) 3z°?—1=7 is nota linear equation in one variable because its degree is 2.

2.2.2 Solution of Linear Equation in one variable:-

In equation, Equal (=) sign divides the equation in two parts i.e. Left part is called Left Hand
Side (LHS) and Right part is called Right Hand Side (RHS) i.e. value of left part = value of right
part. This is true for particular values of the variable and these particular values are called the solu-
tions of the equation. Linear equation in one variable has one solution. That means only one value of
the variable satisfies the equation.

eg: 4x=8

LHS = 4x
@  Ifx=1

4x = 4*1=4

RHS = 8

LHS + RHS

For x= 1,
Value of left part # value of right part
“. X= 1 is not a solution of the given equation.
(ii) Ifx=2 then LHS = 4x= 4(2)=8
RHS =8
LHS = RHS
Here , value of left part = value of right part
“. x = 2 is a solution of the given equation.
2.3 Solving equations having variables on both sides
In last section, we have discussed the equation having variable on one side and In this
section, we shall discuss the equations having variables on both sides.

First, we adjust variable on one side and constants on other side then we shall solve as
discussed in previous sections.
Example 2.1 : Solve:-
(i) 4x-—3=3x+2 (ii) 3x+4=x-6
(iii) 4x-—S=7x+8
Sol. (@) Wehave 4x-3=3x+2
4x = 3x +2+ 3 (transposing—3 to RHS)
4x=3x+5
transposing 3x to LHS we get
4x -3x=5
=> x=5
which is the required answer.
Or We can solve this equation by transposing variable and constant together.
we have 4x — 3 =3x+2
Transposing — 3 to RHS and 3x to LHS, we get
4x -—3x=+2+3
=> *.=5

which is the required solution.

(i) wehave 3x+4=x-—6
Transposing +4 to RHS and x to LHS, we get

3x-x=-6-4

=> 2x=-10 =: aa a
which is the required solution.

(ii) we have, 4x-5=7x+8
Transposing —4 to RHS and 7x to LHS, we get
4x-—7x=+8+5

2.4 Some Practical Applications
Example 2,3 : A positive number is 5 times another number. If 21 is added to both the

numbers then larger number becomes twice the shorter number. What are the
numbers?

Suppose the shorter number be x

As given ; Larger number = 5 x (shorter number) = 5x

According to another condition

If 21 is added to both numbers then numbers are (x + 21) and (5x + 21)
Now, larger number = 2 * shorter number

=> §x+21=2 (x +21)

=> 5x+21=2x+42 = S5x-2x= 42-21

=> 3x=21
wo

So, numbers are x and 5x i.e. 7 and 5 x 7=35

Example 2.4 : A number consists of two digits and sum of digits is 8. If 18 is added to the

Sol.

number, its digits are reversed. Find the number.
We are given a two-digit number which consists ones place digit and tens place digit.
Given condition:- Sum of digits = 8
ie. sum of ones digit & tens digit = 8
Let ones digit be x
then tens digit be 8 — x
“. Two digit number = 10 x (tens digit) + (ones digit)

= 10 (8 —x)+x=80- 10x+x

= 80 - 9x

Now, number obtained by reversing the digits
= 10 * (ones digit) + (tens digit)
=10xx+(8—x)=9x+8
2" condition :- 18 added to original number = number obtained by reversing the digits
18 + (Two-Digit number) = number obtained by reversing digits
= 18 + (80 — 9x) =9x +8
= 98 —9x=9x+8
=> 98 —8=9x+9x = 90 = 18x

90,
=>x is
-. Two-digit number = 80 — 9x = 80 — 9 (5)

= 80 - 45 =35

Example 2.5 ; Shobo's mother's present age is six times Shobo's present age. Shobo's age
five years from now will be one third of his mother's present age. What are their
present ages?

Sol. Given Condition:-
Shobo's mother's present age = 6 x Shobo's present age
Suppose shobo's present age be x years
Shobo's mother's present age be 6x years
Now,

Shobo's age five years from now = 3 of Mother’s present age

1
=x S= 5X xa xt+5= 2x

= 5=2x-x=x > x=5
Hence, Shobo's present age = 5 years
and Shobo's mother's present age = 6 x 5 = 30 years

Understanding Quadrilaterals

In this chapter you will learn:
* To differentiate between different types of quadrilaterals on basis
of their properties and establish relationship between them.

3.1 Introduction :-

In our daily life, we come across various plane surfaces such as blackboard in the class, a
page of a book, top of a table etc.

Figure 3.1

These are perfect samples or models for a plane surface. We know that a paper is the
sample or model of the surface.

42=L4 [alternate interior angles
AC = AC (Common)
* AABC = ACDA (ASA congruency)

In AABC and ACDA, We get 2

AC =AC (common)
Bx AABC =ACDA (ASA congruency)
=> ZB =ZD (cp.ct.) es
Similarly, we can prove ZA = ZC by joining diagonal BD-
Thus, In a parallelogram the opposite angles are equal.

Property 3 : In a parallelogram, the sum of any two adjacent angles is 180°.

Proof: Let ABCD bea parallelogram. So AB||CD
and AD is a transversal line which intersects them at

Aand D respectively.

As, we know that sum of interior angles on the same
side of transversal between parallel lines is 180°.

ZA+ZD = 180°
Similarly, we can prove that

ZA+ ZB = 180°
and ZB+ZC =180°
and Z£C+2ZD = 180°

Example 3.2 : Two adjacent angles of a parallelogram are equal, What is the measure of each
angle?
Sol. Let the measure of each of adjacent angles be x.
We know that sum of adjacent angles of a parallelogram is 180°
x+x=180° = 2x=180°

Sol. Let ABCD bea parallelogram. B
Such that ZA : ZB = 2:3
Let ZA = 2x and ZB = 3x
We know that sum of adjacent angles of'a parallelogram is 180°,

Example 3.5 : In Fig, PQRS is a parallelogram. Find the values of x, y and z.
Sol. Since, opposite angles of a parallelogram are equal.
x= 110°
Since, sum of adjacent angles of a parallelogram is 180°
y + 110°= 180°
=> y=180°- 110°=70°
Clearly y + z = 180° (Linear Pair)

Proof: Let ABCD be a parallelogram and
draw its diagonals AC and BD intersecting each other at O.
In AAOB and ACOD, We have
AB =CD_— (Opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal

ZOAB = ZOCD (altemate interior angles)
ZOBA = ZODC (alternate interior angles)
.. AAOB = ACOD (ASA congruency criterion)

=> OA=OC and OB= OD (cpet.)

Thus, In a parallelogram the diagonals bisect each other.

3.4 Rhombus : F

A rhombus is quadrilateral with sides of equal length.
Or A parallelogram having its adjacent sides equal is called a rhomt
ABCD is a rhombus in which AB = BC = CD=DA

Since rhombus is a parallelogram, so all properties of parallelogram will be contained in rhombus i.e.
(i) Opposite pair of sides are parallel.
(i) Opposite angles are equal.

(iii) Sum of adjacent angles is 180°.

(iv) Diagonals bisect each other

Property 5 : The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles.

Proof: Let ABCD be a rhombus and its diagonals AC and BD intersect at O.
Since every rhombus is a parallelogram.
We know, the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.
Now, To prove that the diagonals of the rhombus ABCD are perpendicular to each other.
So in AAOB and ABOC, We have D
AO = OC (0 is mid point of AC)

ic

OB = OB (common)

AB = BC (Sides of a rhombus)
AAOB = ABOC (SSS congruency criterion)
=> ZAOB = ZBOC [c.p.c.t.]
Since ZAOB + ZBOC = 180° (Linear Pair)
ZAOB + ZAOB = 180°
180
=> 2ZAOB = 180° = ZAOB = > = 90°

Thus, the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at 90°.

Example 3.9: Inthe given figure, RICE is a rhombus. Find x, y and z.
Sol. We know, diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other. c
OR=0C > y=12 ft

and OE=OI => x=5

Since all sides of the rhombus are equal. ' £415 \
z=13 \ ’ f

Example 3.10: The diagonals of a rhombus are 6cm and 8cm. Find the side of the rhombus.
Sol. Let ABCD be a rhombus in which diagonals AC = 8cm and BD = 6cm.
Since diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at 90°.

1 I
OA= > AC = 5 x8 = 4em

i i
and OB = > BD= > 6 =3cm

2 2
In right AOAB,
By Pythagoras theorem,

AB? = OA? + OB?
= AB?=4?+3?=16+9-25-5?
= AB=Scem. Thus, side of rhombus is 5cm.

3.5 Rectangle :-

A parallelogram having all angles equal, is called rectangle.
Property 1 : Each angle of a rectangle is a right angle.
Proof Let ABCD be a rectangle.

Since rectangle is a parallelogram having all angles equal,

> ZA=ZB= ZC =2D

We know, ZA + ZB + ZC + ZD = 360°

ZA+ ZA+ ZA+ ZA =360°

360!
= 4ZA=360 => ZA= 4 = 90°

ZA= ZB = ZC = 2D =90° Figure 3.28
Thus, Each angle of the rectangle is right angle.

Property 2 : The diagonals of a rectangle are equal.
Proof: Let ABCD be a rectangle with diagonals AC and BD,
In ADAB and ACBA, we have
AD=BC (opposite sides of a rectangle)
AB=AB (common)
ZDAB = ZCBA (Each 90°)
ADAB = ACBA (SAS congruency criterion)
=> BD =AC (c.p.ct.)
Hence, the diagonals of a rectangle are equal.

Sol. We know, each angle of a rectangle is 90°.
In APQR, we have
ZQPR + ZPQR + ZPRQ =180°
= 32°+ 90° + ZPRQ = 180°
= 122°+ ZPRQ =180° -
=> ZPRQ = 180° — 122° = 58° Pp “Figure 3.30 Q

Data Handling

In this chapter, you will learn:-
+ About collection and presentation of Data in various forms.
To represent the data as histograms & pie charts
To interpret the histrograms and pie charts,
To Use the histograms and pie chart in daily life situation.
Introduction of chances and probability.
To relate chances and probability to real life problems.

4.1 Raw Data / Primary Data:

Statistics has gained very important place in the modern world and data is the base on which
the structure of statistical investigation is made, The success and failure of investigation mainly de-
pends upon the quality and accuracy of data. The word ‘data* means ‘information’. Collection of
data is the first step in any statistical investigation. The numerical observations collected by an ob-
server cannot be put to any use immediately and directly. So it is called raw data or primary data,

For example, the marks (out of 20) of 10 students of class 8* are 12, 15, 18, 10, 13, 19, 20,
14, 12, 10

Here, each entry in the above list is a numerical fact which is called an observation. Such a
collection of observations gathered or collected initially is called raw data. So “Primary data or
raw data is the data which is originally collected by an investigator or agency for the first
time for some specific purpose.”

4.2 Presentation of Data:-

After collecting data, the investigator has to find ways to present them in tabular form. Such an
arrangement is called presentation of data.

The raw data can be arranged in following ways:

(i) Alphabetical order or Serial order.
(i) Ascending or Descending order.

The raw data when put in ascending or descending order is called an array.

For Example,

The marks obtained by 10 students in a class test, out of 25 marks, according to their
roll numbers be.

18, 21, 17, 13, 5, 14, 20, 24, 19, 16

This data in this form is called raw data or primary data or ungrouped data. The above data
can be arranged in serial order as follows:-

| roto. {1 [2 [3 [a |s |6 |7|s/ 9 | 0

[mais obiained [1s [21 [a7 [as [5 [14 [20 [24 [19 | a6]

Table 4.1

Page_Number 63 ended
/n
Page_Number 64 started
But data in this group does not give us a clear picture of the standard achievement of the group.
If we arrange them in ascending or descending order then it gives us a slighty better picture,
In ascending order:-
5, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24
In descending order:-
24, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 14, 13, 5
Ifthe number of observations is large then arranging data in ascending or descending or serial
order is very tough and tedious job. To make it easily understandable and clear, we can tabulate data
in the form of Frequency Distribution
4.3 Frequency Distribution or Frequency Table:-
It is a method to present raw data in the form which we can easily understand. Frequency
distributions or tables are of two types:-
(i) Discrete frequency distribution
(ii) Continuous frequency distribution
4.3.1. Discrete frequency Distribution:- The construction of a discrete frequency distribu-
tion from the given raw data is done by the use of tally marks.
Tally marks. In tally marks, we use the following symbols.

Let's discuss some examples:
Example 4.1: A die was thrown 25 times and following scores were obtained:
1,:5,.2;:4; 33:6; 13-4; 2535,.1;:6,.25°6; 3; Ss; 4)1,.3) 253.6. US: 2:
Prepare a frequency table for the scores.
Sol.

hw BU ws

Example 4.2 : Prepare a frequency oF of the favourite subject of a group of 22 students
which is as follows:
Punjabi, Mathematics, Science. English, Punjabi, English, Mathematics, Mathematics,
Science, Punjabi, Punjabi, Science, Science, Mathematics, Punjabi, English, Punjabi, English,
Science, Punjabi, Science, Mathematics.
Also answer that which is the most liked subject and the least liked?

Page_Number 65 started
Table 4.4
It is clear from the table that maximum students like Punjabi subject and least number of stu-
dents like ec a Subject.

4. 3.2 ‘Continuous Sueeaie Distribution:-

The above method of presenting the raw data is convenient and easy where the values in the
raw data are largely repeating. But If the number of observations are not repeating and difference
between the greatest and the smallest observations is large then we arrange the data into classes or
groups. Let's discuss with some examples.

Example 4.3 : The weekly wages (in 2) of 30 workers in a factory are
830, 835, 890, 810, $35, 869, 836, 890, 898, 845, $32, 820, 860, 833, 845, 855, $12,
808, 804, 835, 840, 835, 885, 836, 878, 840, 868, 890, 806, 840.
Using tally marks, make a frequency table with intervals as 800-810, 810-820 and so

800-810
810-820
820-830
830-840
840-850
850-860

860-870

880-890
890-900

Note:

Data presented in this manner is said to be grouped and the distribution obtained is called
grouped frequency distribution. It helps us to draw meaningful results.

In Above Example:

(i)
i)

*

The weekly wages of most workers are between & 830 and = 840.
4 workers are taking highest wages more than & 890.
Now. here we shall defi2ne some terms related to grouped frequency distribution.

Class Interval:- Each of the groups 800-810, 810-820 and so on are called class-intervals
Here observe that $10 occurs in both classes ie 800-810 and 810-820. But it is not
possible that an obseryation can belong simultaneously to two classes.

“To avoid this, we adopt the convention that the common observation will belong to
the higher class i.e. 810 belongs to 810-820 (not to 800-810). " Similarly 820 belongs
to 820-830 (not to 810-820)

Lower class limit:- In class interval, smaller value is called lower class limit.

For example, in class interval 800-810, the lower class limit is 800.

Similarly, In 810-820, the lower class limit is 810.

Upper Class limit:- In class interval, higher value is called upper class limit.

For example:- In class interval 800-810, the upper class limit is $10.

Similiarly, in 810-820, the upper class limit is 820.

Class width or class size:- The difference between the upper class limit and the lower
class limit is called the class width or size of the class interval.

Here in all class interval 800-810, 810-820 and so on, class width is 10.

Class Mark:- Mid value of the each class interval is called class mark.

Lower limit + Upper limit

2
For example the class mark of the class interval 800-810 is as follow

— 810 1610 |

i.e. class mark =

4.4 Graphical Method of Representing the data

In previous section, we have learnt how to prepare a frequency distribution table. We have
discussed two types of frequency distributions. Here we shall discuss the graphical representa-
tion of the frequency distribution. In previous classes, we have learnt some graphical represen-
tations like pictograph and Bar graph. We know “A bar graph is the quickest way to represent a
frequency distribution pictorially.” In this section, we shall learn how to represent a grouped fre-
quency distribution graphically, The most common graphical representation is the Histogram.

4.5 Histogram:- ‘A histogram is a graphical representation of a frequency distribution in
the form of rectangles with class intervals as bases and heights proportional to corresponding
frequencies such that there is no gap between any two successive intervals”,

In this chapter, we shall learn construction of histogram for a continuous grouped frequency
distribution with equal class intervals,

Let's discuss it with some examples!

4.6 Circle Graph or Pie Chart:-

Tn previous section, we have learnt about classification and tabulation of data and their graphical
representation by using histograms. In this section, we shall learn diagramatic representation of data,
The diagramatic representation has more preference than the graphic representatian as we can
draw diagrams on any type of paper but for graphical representation, we generally need a graph paper.

In this section, we shall discuss a particular type of diagram, known as circle-graphs or
pie chart to represent the given data,

“A pie chart is a pictorial representation of the numerical data by non-iniersecting adja-
cent sectors of the circle such that area of each sector is proportional to the magnitude of the
data represented by the sector

4.6.1 Drawing a Pie Chart:- Pie Chart shows the relationship between a whole and its parts. The
whole is divided into sectors. The size of each sector is proportional to the information it represents.

We know that the area of a sector is proportional to the angle subtended by it at the centre by
its arc. So, sector angles or central angles are proportional to the component values of the compo-
nents represented by the sectors, The total angle of a circle is 360°,

Value of the component
Sum of the Component valucs
Let's discuss some examples for construction of a pie chart.
Example 4.11 : The favourite flavours of ice-creams for students of a school are given in percentage
as follows:-

Thus, central angle of the components = x 360°

a

Represent this data in a pie chart.
Sol. The total angle at the centre of the circle is 360°. The central angles of the sectors will be
a fraction of 360°.

4.7 Chance and Probability:-
Tn our daily life, we come across many statements like
(i) Probably you are right
(i) It may rain today
(iti) Tndian team has good chance of winning,

In such statements, we generally use the terms: May, probable, likely, chance etc. All these
terms represent the same sense that the event is not certain to take place. Such examples where the
chances of a certain thing happening or not happening are not equal, This is the rough idea of
meaning of ‘probability’, However, in the theory of probability, we assign numerical value to the
degree of uncertainity. The concept of probability originated in the beginning of 18" century in problems
like throwing a die, tossing a coin, drawing a card from a pack of cards etc, Starting with game of
chance, Now it is commonly used in our day-to-day conversation,

Getting a Result:- We know that before a cricket match starts, captains of the two teams
go out to toss a coin to decide that which team will bat first.

+ When a coin is tossed then the possible results are head or tail.

Such an experiment is called a random experiment and Head or Tail are the two out-
comes of this experiment and getting a head or tail is called an event.

For example:- When a die is thrown then outcomes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 and throwing a
die is called a random experiment.

Random experiment or Event

2. Throwing a die 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6
4.7.1 Linking chances to probability:-
* Consider the experiment of tossing a coin once. The outcomes are head or tail. Since both
outcomes has same chance of occuring. Such outcomes are called ‘equally likely out-
comes’. Here, total number of outcomes = 2.

1
Now, getting a head is one out of two outcomes i.e. Bp: we say that the probability of

1 !
getting a head = ry and getting a tail is one out of two outcomes, ie. g> We say that the

1
probability of getting a tail = oy

| Total outcomes | Events | Probability |

Number ofheads = 1 1 out of 2 ie.

Number of tails 1 out of Zi.

* Consider the experiment of throwing a die once. The outcomes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. All
outcomes are equally likely outcomes.

CHAPTER

Squares and Square Roots

In this chapter you will learn:
+ To find Square of a number.

+ About perfect square number and different properties of squared nu
bers,

* Yo find square root of a number using different methods.
* Touse concept of square and square roots in solving practical life problems.

5.1 Introduction:-

In Geometry, you have learnt about square. You also know that area of a square = side *
side (where side means, the length of a side)

Now, see the following numbers : 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, ....... etc.
What is special in these numbers,

Since 1=1* 1;4=2*%2:;9=3%*%3;16=4%4;25=5%*5;36=6 = 6 and so on,
so all such numbers can be expressed as the product of some number with itself.

Such numbers like 1, 4, 9, 16, 25. 36, ....... are known as Perfect squares or Square
numbers.

Tn general, if a natural number m can be expressed as n?, where nis also a natural number,
then, that number m is a perfect square or a square number,

Example Is 49 a perfect square?
Sol. First we shall express 49 as a product of two natural numbers.
ie, 4A9= 7x7
Here we see 49 can be expressed as the product of number 7 with itself.
So, 49 is a perfect square
Example Is 27 a perfect square number?
Sol. First we shall express 27 as a product of two natural numbers.
ie. 27=3x9
= 1x 27

Page_Number 93 ended
/n
Page_Number 94 started
Here we see that 27 cannot be expressed as the product of some number with itself.

Hence 27 is not a perfect square number, or we can say that 27 is not a square of any
natural number.

Similarly 8, 10, 13, 58, 176 etc are not perfect square numbers.
So we can say that all the natural numbers are not Perfect Squares.
5.2 Properties of Square Numbers:
Study the following table, which shows the squares of first 30 natural numbers.

Property 1 ; Square numbers (perfect square numbers) always end with the digits 0, 1. 4, 5,
6 or 9.

From above table, we observe that digits at ones place of square number which are Red in
colour, are 0, 1, 4, 5. 6 and 9. None of these have 2, 3, 7 or 8 at ones place.

Can we say that if a number ends with 0, 1, 4, 5, 6 and 9 then it must be a square
number?

No, it is not always true.

For example. numbers 10 and 20 end with 0 but they are not perfect squares.

Similarly 11, 21, 31 etc end with 1 but they are also not perfect squares.

Number 14, 15, 24, 26, 29 etc. are some more examples whose ones digits are 4, 5, 6
and 9, but they are not perfect squares.

So, we can say that if a number ends with 0, 1. 4, 5, 6 or 9 then it may or may not be a
perfect square.

A number ending in 2, 3, 7 or 8 can never be a perfect square.

For example 22, 33, 237, 2378, 3542, 15437 etc. are not perfect squares.

Example 5.1 Write five numbers on which you can decide by looking at their ones digit
that they are not square numbers. (perfect square)
Sol. We know the numbers ending with 2, 3, 7 or 8, can never be perfect square.
So five numbers are 62, 93, 147, 228, 222 eic.
Example 5.2 Write five numbers on which you cannot decide just by looking at their ones
digit that whether they are square numbers or not.
Sol. We know the numbers ending with 0, 1, 4, 5, 6 or 9 may or may not be a square number. So,
we cannot decide just by looking at the numbers ending with these digits. Some examples are
120, 221, 534, 565, 216, 219 etc.
Property 2: The number of zeroes at the end of a square number is always even.
Observe the last row of the given table, which is in Green Colour.
We see that, all the perfect squares have even number of zeroes at the end.

For Example: 107 = 10x10 = 100
207 = 2020 = 400
30? == 30x30 = 900

Some other example 607 = 60x60 = 3600
100? = 100x100 = 10000

(Therefore, the number of zeroes at the end of the square of a number is twice the
number of zeroes at the end of the number )

It is not always true that a number ending with even number of zeroes is always a perfect

square. It may or may not be a perfect square.
For example, 400 is a perfect square but 300, 500 and 700 are not,
A number ending with odd number of zeroes is never a perfect square.
For example 10, 110, 1000, 5000, ends with odd number of zeroes. Hence none of these
numbers is a perfect square.

Example 5.3. What will be the number of zeroes in the square of the following numbers.
@) 60 (ii) 200 (iii) $000

Sol. (@ As 60 has one zero at end, so its square will have two zeroes at end.

(@) As 200 has two zeroes at end, so its square will have four zeroes at end.
(ii) As 8000 has 3 zeroes at end, so its squares will have 6 zeroes at end.

Property 3: Square of an even number is always even.
See the table, numbers marked with magenta colour.

/n
Page_Number 96 started
Property 4: Square of an odd number is always odd,

See the table, numbers marked with blue colour.

Property 5: Ones digit of square of a number :
Observe the ones digit of the number and ones digit of square of that number. We have the
following result -

Ones digit of Number | Ones digit of squared number
(Square ends)
ee ee

| dors |

We can observe that from the ones digit of a number, we can find the ones digit of its
square number.

Also from the ones digit of the square number, we can find the ones digit of the number.

Example 5.4 : What will be the ones digit in the square of following numbers?

Sol.

(i) 211 (ii) 299 (iii) 1018 = (iv) 1687 — (v) 4204

() As ones digit of 211 is 1, so ones digit of its square will be 1.

(ii) As ones digit of 299 is 9, so ones digit of its square will be 1.

(ii) As ones digit of 1018 is 8, so ones digit of its square will be 4.

(tv) As ones digit of 1687 is 7, so ones digit of its square will be 9.

(vy) As ones digit of 4204 is 4, so ones digit of its square will be 6.

Property 6: There are 2n natural numbers between the squares of two consecutive numbers

ie. nandn+ 1,

For example, take n= 1 and n+ 1=2. Now between (1)? and (2)? (between 1 and 4)
there are 2 x n= 2» 1=2 natural numbers (i.e. 2 and 3)

Consider n= 4 and n+ 1 = 5, Now between (4)? = 16 and (5)?=25 there are 2 x n=2
x 4=8 natural numbers (i.e.17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24)

Example 5.5 : How many natural numbers lie between
(i) ¥ and (ii) 117 and 12?
Sol. As we know that there are 2n numbers between n’? and (n+1)’, So
(i) 8? = 64 and 9?= 81,
there are 2 « 8 =16 natural numbers between them
{fasn=8,n+1=8+1=9]
(ii) 11? = 121 and 12? =144
there are 2 x 1] = 22 natural numbers between them
[as n= 11, n+] = 12]
Property 7: Square of a number n can be expressed as the sum of the first n odd natural

numbers.
ie. sum of first n odd natural numbers = r?
e.g. 2?=4= 1+3 (Here! and 3 are the first two odd natural number)

3?=9= 1+3+5 (Here 1,3 and 5 are the first 3 odd natural numbers)
#=16=1+3+5+7 (Here 1, 3, 5 and 7 are the first 4 odd natural numbers)
§7=25=14+3+5+7+9 (Here 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 are the first 5 odd natural numbers)
So we can say
| Daal fea
ie. sum of first n odd natural numbers = r?

12 = l

Li = 121

nv = 123251

ll? = 1234321

Liv = 123454321

On observing the above pattern, the square of any number of the type 1111111...... can be
easily calculated.

Here we observe that

(i) The digits in the squares is a combination of ascending and descending order of digits.
(i) There are odd numbers of digits in the squares.
(iii) The central digit in the square number is equal to the number of Is in the number.
(iv) The first and last digits are always 1.
4. Observe the squares of 7, 67, 667....... . Here also observe a very intersting pattern.
Bi = 49

6? = 4489
6677 = 444889
6667? = 44448889
Here we observe that

(i) All the squares end with digit 9.
(i) The numbes of 4s in the square of number is one more than the number of 6s in number,
(ii) The number of 8s is the square of number is same as the number of 6s in the number.

§. Observe the squares of 5, 15, 25, 35, 45............. i.e, the number having 5 as ones digit, it

also follow a very interesting pattern.

’ = 2 = 0 = 1(bundred) + 5?
187 = 225 = 1% 2 (hundred) + 5?
257 = 625 = 2 x 3 (bundred) + 5?

105? = 11025 = 10 x 11 (hundred) + 5?
Or

(a5P= ax (a+1) hundred + 5?
6. Observe the following interesting patterns :
1?+2?+2? =3?
P+3+6? =7
37 + 47 + 12? = 13?
4 + 52 + 20? = 21% ete.
Here we observe, ignoring the squares, the first two numbers on the LHS are consecutive
numbers and third number is the product of first two numbers. The number on the RHS is
the successor of third number of LHS.

ie, a? +(at+1)?+(a(a+ DY =[a(at+1)+1P
Example 5.10 ; Express 21? as a sum of squares of 3 numbers,
Sol. Here we have to express 21’ as a sum of squares of 3 numbers.
a+b? + o2 = 21?

If we ignore the square, c will be the predecessor of 21 i.e. 20.
Now 20 is equal to product of two consecutives numbers i.e 4 and 5.
So 21=(4 + (5)?+ (20)?

Pythagorean Triplets

We know that, in a right angled tnangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the
squares of the other two sides, which is the Pythagoras Theorem.

So Pythagorean triplet refers to a group of 3 numbers which follows the Pythagoras Theorem.

3 numbers, named a, b and c are known as Pythagorean triplet ifa? + b? =

Consider three numbers 3, 4 and 5

Now (3)?= 9, (4)? = 16 and (5)? = 25

Hee 3?+47= 9
ie = 9 +16 = 25
05 = 25

Hence 3, 4 and § forms a Pythagorean triplet.
There are uncountable number of Pythagorean triplets.
Some of them are (6, 8, 10), (5, 12, 13) etc.

For any natural number n>1, we have
(2n)? + (nP-1)? = (1
So (2n, n?-1, n*+1) forms a Pythagorean triplet.
By this we can easily found a Pythagorean triplet.
Note: All Pythagorean triplets may not be obtained using this method.
Example 5.11: Write a Pythagorean triplet with 6 as one of the numbers of the triplet.
Sol. We can get Pythagorean triplet by using the general form 2n, n?—1, n*+1
Letus take 2n=6 => n=3
So n?'-1=3?—1=8andn?+1=3?+1=10
So Pythagorean triplet is 6, 8 and 10.
Example 5.12: Find a Pythagorean triplet whose one of the number is 15.
Sol. We can get Pythagorean triplet by using the general form 2n, n’—1, n?+1

15
Let us take 2n = 15 =} 2= >" which is not a natural number

So we cannot takes 2n = 15
So, letustake n’-1=15

=r =16
=>n=4
2n=2x4=8

also n?—1=(4"-1=16-1=15
also n?+1=(42 +1=16+1=17
So required triplet is (8, 15, 17)

this purpose we have concept of square root,
Let we are given a number K. we need to find a number which when squared gives K. In other
words we are simply going to reverse the process.
«. Square root can be defined as inverse of doing square:

§.3.1 Finding Square Roots

Before we Jearn how to find square root of a number we must know why we need to find
square root of a number? Consider the following situations:
1. We know that area of square = (Side)?
If you are given area of square as 3125cn* how will you find its side?
Suppose you are given with sides of a rectangle, how will you find the diagonal?
3, Suppose you have a right triangle whose adjacent sides are given, how will you calculate its
hypotenuse?
In all above situations and many other similar situations we need to calculate square root at
some stage,
Before we learn to calculate square root of a number. Let's connect square and square root of
a number through properties already learnt,
1, Square root of even number is even and that of odd number is odd.

ie. 196-14 as 14*= 196

and ./225—15 as 15?=225
2. Ones place digit of square root of any perfect square number ending with 1 is either | or 9.

ié jf121-11 a 12?=121

and 361-19 as 19°=361
3. Ones place digit of square root of any perfect square number ending with 4 is either 2 or 8.

ie = ff44—12 as) 127 = 144

and ./324 18 as 18? = 324

Page_Number 105 ended

Page_Number 106 started
4. Ones place digit of square root of a perfect square ending with 9 is either 3 or 7.
ie. 169-13 as 13? = 169

and J729 =27 as 27? = 729

5. Ones place digit of square root of any perfect square ending with 5 is 5.
ie. /225—15 as 15?=225

and .f625—25 as 25?=625
6. Any number which ends with 2, 3, 7, 8 or have odd number of zeros at its end cannot be
a perfect square. Square root of these type numbers will not be a natural number.
e.g. 232, 407, 1603, 1008 and 1690 can never be a perfect square numbers.
Example 5.13 Fill in the blanks

(ii) As 142= 196 So 196 = 14

§.3.2 Finding square root by repeated subtraction

As we have learnt earlier that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is n?_ That is,
every square number can be expressed as sum of consecutive odd natural number starting

from 1. consider 49
Step (i) 49-1-=48 Step (ii) 48 -3 = 45 Step (iii) 45 — 5 = 40
Step (iv) 40 — 7 = 33 Step (v) 33 -9 = 24 Step (vi) 24-11 = 13
Step (vii) 13 — 13 =0
We can write 49=1+34+5+7+5+9+ 11413
Se here we have started subtracting successive odd natural numbers starting from 1 and
obtained 0 at 7th step, So 49 =7
Example 5.14 By repeated subtraction of odd numbers starting from 1, find whether the

following numbers are perfect square or not? if number is perfect square, find its
square root.

(a) 36 (b)55 (c) 121
Sol, (a) The given number is 36, Start subtracting the odd numbers starting from |
(i) 36 —1=35 (ii) 35 -3 - 32 (iii) 32 —-5 = 27
(iv)27-7=20 (v)20-9=11 (vi) 11-11=0

101

Page_Number 106 ended
/n
Page_Number 107 started
As we have obtained 0, so 36 is a perfect square and we obtained 0 at 6th step
so V36 —6
(b) (i) 55—1=54 (ii) 54-3 =51 (iii) 51 - 5 = 46
(iv) 46-7=39 (v)39-9=30 (vi) 30 —- 11=19
(vii) 19-13=06 (viii) 6-15 =-9
As we did not get zero, hence 55 is not a perfect square number.
(c) (i) 121-1=120 (ii) 120-3 =117 Gi) 117 -5 = 112
(iv) 12—7=105 (v) 105-9=96 (vi) 96 — 11 = 85
(vii) 85-13 =72 (viii) 72-15 =57 (ix) 57 - 17 = 40
(x)40-19=21 (xi) 21-21=0
As we got zero, so 121 is a perfect square number.

and we obtained 0 at 11th step so J/121 —11
Now can you find ./625 using this method? Yes, but it will be time consuming. We
have another methods for finding the square root. We will discuss in next section.
§.3.3 Finding square root through prime factorisation :
Consider the prime factorisation of some numbers and their squares, as shown in table 6,7
reer eee
of number number square of number
2x2x2x2
2x2x3x3

2*2x2*x2*x2x2
3x3 x33
*2x5*5

2x2x2x2x3x3
3x3 x5x5

On observing given table, you will see that 2 occurs twice in prime factorisation of
4 and 2 occurs 4 times in the prime factorisation of 16. Similarly, How many times 2
occur in prime factorisation of 6? It is one time. Now how many times does 2 occur in the
prime factorisation of 36? It is two times. Similarly observe the occurrence of 3 in 6 and 36,

You will find that each prime factor in the prime factorisation of the square of a number,
occurs twice the number of times it occurs in the prime factorisation of the number itself: Let us
use this to find the square root of a given number say 100.

102

Page_Number 107 ended
/n
Page_Number 108 started
The prime factorisation of 100 is as 100 =2 =x 2* 5x5 100
By pairing the prime factors,we get 50
100=2x2x5x5=2?x S2=(2 x 5)
25
So /f00 =2*5=10 F

Similarly, we can find the square root of 144,
The Prime Factorisation of 144 is
144 = 2*x2*2x2x3x3

= 22x 22x 32= (2 «2 x 3P

So [44 =2*2x3=12
Ts 48 a perfect square?
We know 48 = 2x 2*2*x2*3 1
Since one factor (3) of 48 is not in pair, so 48 is not a perfect square
Suppose we want to find the smallest number which will make 48 a perfect square, how
should we proceed? In the prime factorisation of 48 we see that 3 is the only factor that
does not have a pair. So we need to multiply 48 by 3 to complete the pair.
Hence 48 « 3 = 144 is a perfect square
Now can you tell by which smallest number should we divide 48 to get a perfect square?
As we have seen the factor 3 is not in pair, so if we divide 48 by 3,
we get 48 + 3 = 16 which is a perfect square

Example 5.15 Find the square root of the following numbers by method of Prime factorisation
(i) 729 (ii) 9604

Sol. Let us find the prime factoisation of the given numbers is -

0)

729 Gi)
243

So 729=3%*3*x3x3x3x3 So 9604 =2x2x7x7x7xX7

ie. 729 = 37 x 32 x 34 ie. 9604 = 2? x 72 x 7?

729 =(3 x3 x 3 9604 =(2* 7 * 7P

Hence ./729 =3* 3% 3=27 Hence 9604 =2 x 7* 7=98
Example 5.16 For each of the following numbers, find the smallest number by which it should

be multiplied to get a perfect square number. Also, find the square root of the
perfect square number so obtained. (i) 180 (ii) 768

103

Page_Number 108 ended
/n
Page_Number 109 started
Sol.

(i) Let us find the prime factorisation of 180. 180

Now 180 = 2x2x3x3x5
= 22x 32x 5)
The prime factor 5, does not occur in pair. So we need
to multiply 180 by 5 to get a perfect square number.
Now 180 x 5=900=2*2*3x3x5x5=2?x 3% x 52
ie. 900 = (2 x 3 « 5)* = (30)?

so 900 = 30
(i) Let us find the Prime factorisation of 768.

768 =2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2xZ
Here 3 is the only factor that does not occur in pair
So we need to multiply 768 by 3 to
complete the pair, So new number is
768 x 3 = 2304

= 2x2K2xX2*2xX2x*2x2x3x3
Le, 2304 = 2? x 22 x 2? x 2? x 3?

2304 =(2* 2x2* 2x 3)2?=(48"

Hence ./2304 =48

Let us find the Prime factorisation of 9408
9408 =2x2x2x2x2x2x3x7*7
Here except 3, all factors are in pairs.
So if we divide 9408 by 3, then
9408 + 3 = 3136
S2ZxX2xX2xX2x2x%2xX7x7 =P x Dx 2x P
=(2x2x2x 7)

which is a perfect square and
3136 = 2% 2xX2x7=56 ]

As we have to plant as many plants in each row as the number of rows, So number of
plants will be a squared number.

Let number of plants in each row = number of rows = x

As per question x x x = 2025
ie. x? = 2025
To find x, we have to find a number whose square is 2025.

2025
675

Le. x is square root of 2025

Now 2025 = 3x3x3x3x5x5 = 32 x 32 x 5?
ie, 2025 =(3 x3 x S$?

So 2025 =3*3*5=45

Hence number of rows and number of plants in each row are 45.
Example 5.19: Find the smallest square number which is divisible by each of numbers 8, 12, 50.

Sol. As required number is divisible by each of 8, 12 and 50 21 8-12-50
We have to find L.C.M. of 8, 12 and 50 2|4-6-25
L.CM (8, 12, 50) =2x2x2x3x5x5 >12-3-25
= 600 g | t=3=95
But 600 is not a perfect square. 5 | 1-1-25
So we have to make perfect square: 5]1-1-5
We have 600 = 2x2x2x3x5x5 l-1-1

Since, to make 600 a perfect square, we have to multiply it with 2 and 3.
ie. 600 x 2x 3 = 3600
3600 is a perfect square which is divisible by 8, 12 and 50.

4 Finding Square Root by Long Division Method

Consider a number 16777216. If we find its square root by prime factorisation it involve

division by 2, 24 times which makes it quite lengthy that is why we use long division method
for such problems. Before solving such question let us learn to find number of digits in square

root

ofa number. Observe the following table.

262144
16777216

If you observe carefully we can draw following inference from above table.
{a) If number of digits in squared number are even, then number of digits in square root of

number = >

1
(b) If mumber of digits in number are odd, then numberof digits inits square root of umber = ">

Example 5.20: Find number of digits in square roots of following
(i) 7744 (ii) 15625 (iii) 25600
Sol. (i) Number of digits in 7744 = 4 (Even)

Number of digits in its square root = ; =2
(i) Number of digits in 15625 = 5 (odd)

S+l 6
Number of digits in its square root = —>~ = 5 =3
(iii) Number of digits in 25600 = 5 (odd)
5+1 6
Number of digits in square root of 25600 = ~+- = 5 =3

Now we can move further to find square root of a number by method of long division.

It is very useful method to find the square root of a given square number. Consider the
following steps to find the square root of 625.

Step 1 Place a bar over every Pair of digits starting from the digit at ones place. Ifthe number of
digits are odd, then the left most single digit too will have a bar. So we have § 35

Step 2 Find the largest number whose square is less than or equal
to the number under the extreme left bar (2? < 6 < 32).
Take this number as divisor and the quotient with the num-
ber under extreme left bar (here 6). Divide and get the re-
mainder (2 in this case)

Step 3 Bring down the number under the next bar (25 in this case)
to the nght of remainder

Setp 4 Double the quotient and enter it with a blank on its right

Step 5 Guess a largest possible digit to fill in the blank which will also
become the new digit in the quotient, such that when the new
divisor is multiplied to the new digit in the quotient, the product is
less than or equal to the dividend. In this case 45 * 5 = 225, so
we choose the new digit as 5, to get the remainder.

Step 6 Since the remainder is 0 and no digit left in the given number so (25 = 25

Example 5.21 Find the square root of 1296 using long division method
Sol. Following the above steps

Therefore, 1296 = 36

Example 5.22Find the least number that must be subtracted from 1308 so as to get a

Sol.

perfect square, Also find the square root of the perfect square.
Let us try to find the ./1308 by long division method
we get the remainder 12.

It shows that (36)? is less than 1308 by 12.

This means if we subtract 12 from the number,

we get a perfect square. so the required

perfect square number is

1308 — 12 = 1296 and 1296 = 36

Example 5.23 Find the greatest four digits number which is a perfect square.

Sol.

Greatest 4 digit number is 9999.

Now we will check whether this number is a perfect square.
Otherwise we have to find the nearest number less than 9999,
which is a perfect square, Here 9999 is not a perfect square.
As as we get remainder 198, So If we subtract 198 from
9999, the new number will be a perfect square. So largest
four digit perfect square number = 9999 — 198 = 9801 and

9801 = 99

Example 5.24 Find the least number that must be added to 5615 so as the get a perfect

Sol.

square. Also, find the square root of the perfect square.

We find ./5615 by long division method,
This shows (74)? < 5615
next perfect square is (75)? = 5625
Hence the number to be added is = (75)? — 5615
= §625 — 5615 = 10
So number is $625 and its square root is 75

Example 5.25 Find the smallest four digit number which is a perfect square?

Sol.

The smallest four digit number is 1000, We will check
whether this number is a perfect square. Otherwise we have
to find its nearest four digit number which is a perfect square.
By long division method, we get remainder 39. This show
that 1000 is not a perfect square also.

(31)? < 1000

Next perfect square is (32)*= 1024

Hence the number to be added is = 1024-1000 =24

and square root of 1024 = [024 = 32

So x? = 3136 iex= (3136

So, side of square = 56m

Example 5.27There are 505 students in a school. For a P.T. drill, they have to stand in
such a manner that the number of rows is equal to number of columns. How
many children will be left out in the arrangement.

Sol. As number of rows and columns are equal, so it is a
square arrangement. we have to find nearest number
(smaller) to 505, which is a perfect square
By using long division method, we get the remainder 21.
Tt shows that (22)? is less than 505 by 21.
This means if we subtract 21 from 505, we get a perfect square.
Hence 505 — 21 = 484 students can be arranged in equal number of rows and
columns. 21 students will be left out in the arrangement.

5.4 Square Root of Decimal Numbers :

Step 1

Step 2

Step 3

To find the square root of a decimal number, we will follow the steps given below.
Consider the number is 51.84

We put bars on the integral part (here 51) of the number in the usual manner and place
bars on the decimal part (here 84) on every pair of digits beginning with the first decimal

place. proceed as usual, we get 51.84

Now proceed in similar manner. The left most bar is 51 and
7*< 51 < $2, take 7 as divisor and the number under the left
most bar as the dividedie, 51

~
i '

<|

+

Divide and get the remainder
The remainder is 2. Write the number under the next bar (i.e. 84) 7| 51.84
to the right of remainder, we get 284 -49

14_] 284

Page_Number 116 ended
/n
Page_Number 117 started
Step 4 Double the quotient (i-e. 7) and enter a blank on its right. Since 7) 51.84
84 is the decimal part so put a decimal point in the quotient i.e 14_| 284
(after 7)

Step 5 We know 142 x 2 = 284, So the new digit is 2, Divide and get
the remainder

Step 6 Since the remainder is zero and no bar left, therefore 51.84 =7.2
Example 6.28: Find the square root of 31.36

31.36 = 5.6

Note : Let us learn how to put bars in a decimal numbers. Consider a number say
325.732, it has two parts : ‘integral and decimal parts. For integral part 325, we start
from the unit's place (here 5) and move towards left, The first bar is over 25 and the

second bar is over 3. For decimal part 732, we start from decimal and move towards
right. First bar is over 73 and for second bar we put 0 after 2 and make 7320

Cube and Cube Roots

In this Chapter you will learn
To find cube of a number.

To learn about different properties of cubes.

To find cube root of a number using different methods.

To use concept of cube and cube roots in solving practical life
problems.

6.1 Introduction :-

The greatesi Indian Mathematician S. Ramanujan experimented with numbers throughout
his life. He loved the numbers. Once another famous mathematician Prof. G.H. Hardy came to
visit him in a taxi, whose number was 1729, While talking to Ramanujan, he described the taxi
number as “a dull number’. But Ramanujan quickly pointed out that the number 1729 is a very
interesting number. He said ii is the smallest number that can be expressed as a sum of two cubes
in two different ways, as

1729 = 1728 + 1 = 12° + 1? and 1729 = 1000 + 729 = 105+ 9

1729 has since been known as Hardy-Ramanujan number. There are infinitaly many such numbers,
Few of them are 4104 {(2, 16); (9, 15)}, 13832 {(18, 20); (2, 24)} ete.

6.2 Cube :-

Cube of any number is when its exponent is 3 i.e, when some number is raised to power three.

For example cube of 2 is written as 2° which is equal to 2 x 2 = 2.

We can say that cube of any number is a number when that number is mutliplied three times by itself:

ForExample: 8? = 8x88 =512

123 = 12*12x12 = 1728
Po = 7XTXT = 343

In Geometry, we use the word cube. A cube is a solid figure whose all sides are equal. (Fig.

6.1), It has six faces, all are squares, for example, dice is a form of cube,

Tow many cubes of side 1 cm will make a cube of side 2 cm ? Observe fig. 6.2, 8 cubes of
side lem will make a cube of side 2cm.
Now consider the numbers 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, ....

Now observe :-
1=1x1*1 8=2x2%*2: 27=3x3x3
64=4x4x4 ; 125=5x5*x5; and so on.

Each of these is obtained when a number is multiplied three times by itself.
These types of numbers are known as Perfect Cube or Cube numbers.
Ts 9 a perfect cube ?
As 9= 3 3 and there is no natural number which when multiplied three times by itself gives
9 So 9 is not a Perfect cube number,

The following are the cubes of numbers form 1 to 20 (the table for cube of a number.)

(Table 6.1)

Now observe, whether cube of even numbers are even ? and cube of odd numbers are odd ?
From table you can observe that cube of even number is even and odd number is odd. Also there are
only few perfect cube numbers from 1 to 1000. How many Perfect cubes are there from 1 to 200 ?

Consider few numbers haying 1 as the digit at Unit’s (ones) place. (Find the cube of them for
example 1, 11, 21, 31, 41, ..., 111, etc.)

=31931%31

= 9261 | =29791

Table 6.2

What can you say about the ones digit of the cube of a number haying 1 as the Unit’s (ones)
place number ? The unit's place digits of cube of a number having 1 as ones digit is 1.

Similarly, explore the ones digit of cubes of numbers ending in 2, 3, 4, ... etc. You will observe
that the ones place digit of the cube of number having ones place 2 is 8; having ones place 3 is 7 and
having ones place 4 is 4.

Example 6.1 ; What should be the ones digit of the cube of cach of the following numbers,
tell without actual calculation?
(i) 2561 (ii) 342 (iii) 463 (iv) 1264

Sol. As we observe that, the ones digit of the cube of number :

(i) 2561 will be |

2. Cubes and their Prime factors
Consider the following Prime factorisation of some numbers and their cubes.
Prime factorisation ofanumber — Prime factorisation of its cube

10=2%*5 10? = 1000. = 2x2x2x5x5x5 = 23 x 53
18=2x3x3 18° = 5832 = 2x2x2x3x3x3Xx3x3x3 = 23x35x33
14=2x*7 14? = 2744 = 2x2x2x77x7 = 23 x 73

15:=3 x4 153 = 3375 = 3x3x3x5x5x5 = 33 x 53

20 = 2x2x5 207 = 8000 = 2x2x2x2x2x2x5x5x5 = 23x23x5*
Observe that each prime factor of a number appears three times in the prime factorisation
of its cube.

In the prime factorisation of any number, if each factor appears three times, then
the number is perfect cube.

(i) 225 (ii) 10648 (iii) 1125 (iv) 2744

6.2.2 Smallest multiple that is Perfect Cube :-

In last section we have observed that every number is not a perfect cube. Ifa number is not a
perfect cube, we can find the smallest natural number by which the given number must be multiplied,
so that the product is a perfect cube, We can also find the smallest number to divide the given
number, so that quotient is a perfect cube.

Example 6.5: Is 243 a perfect cube ? If not, find the smallest number by which 243 must
be multiplied so that the product is a perfect cube. Also find the number.
Sol. The prime factorisation of 243 is 243
243 =3*3x3 x3 x3 =33 x 3?
The prime factor 3 does not appear in a group of three. So
243 is not a perfect cube. To make it perfect cube, we

need one more 3, so to make 243 a perfect cube. we have 2
to multiply it by 3. 3
243 «3 =729=3x3x3x3x3x3=729 1
we o. Sl Lene ee . = .
Now, it is a perfect cube number. Hence, the smallest number to be multiplied is 3 and 729

is the number which is perfect cube-
Example 6.6: Is 675 a perfect cube ? If not, find the smallest natural number by which 675
must be multiplied so that the product is a perfect cube.

Sol. Let us find the prime factorisation of 675
675 =3 x3 x3 «x 5%5 225
——EE
The prime factor 5 does not appear in group of three. 75
So, 675 is not a perfect cube. To make it a perfect cube, 25,
we need one more 5. In that case 5

675 *5=3*%3x3x5 x5 x 5= 3375 1
which is a perfect cube. Hence, the smallest natural number by which 675 should be
multiplied to make it a perfect cube is 5,
Example 6.7; Is 31944 a perfect cube ? If not, then by which smallest natural number
should 31944 be divided so that quotient is a perfect cube ?
Sol. Letus first find the prime factorisation of 31944.
Now 31944=2x2x2*3x* 11x 11x 11
The prime factor 3 does not appear in a group of three,
so 31994 is not a perfect cube, In the factorisation 3
appears only once.
So, if we divide the number by 3, then the
prime factorisation of quotient will not contain 3.
So, 31944 + 3 = 10648

122

Page_Number 127 ended
/n
Page_Number 128 started
Hence the smallest number by which 31944 should be divided to make it a perfect
cube is 3.

The perfect cube in that case is 10648.

6.3 Cube Roots:-

Sometime, we have to find the number whose cube is given. For example, ifthe volume of a
cube is 64 cm’, what should be the length of side of cube ? Now, here we need to find a number
whose cube is 64.

In last chapter we have already studied about square and square root. As you know, finding the
square root is inverse operation of squaring, Similarly, finding the cube root is inverse operation of
finding cube.

We know that 43 = 64, So we say that cube root of 64 is 4. We write 3/64 =4. The symbol

CHAPTER

Comparing Quantities

In this chapter, you will learn
About concept of ratio and percentage.
About concept of marked price. (M.P.) and discount, their percent-
age and their application in daily life.
About sale tax and its application in daily life.
About simple and compound interest and their application in our
daily life.
About bank passbook and how to fill deposit and withdrawl slip.

7.1 Recalling Ratios and Percentage :-

In Class VIL we have already studied about
concept of ratio and proportion, We know, the meaning
of ratio is to compare two quantities. Let us take a
basket having two types of fruits say, apples and bananas
(fig.). Let number of apples be 40 and number of
bananas be 10, then the ratio of number of apples to
the number of bananas is 40 ; 10.

We can also do the comparison by using frac-

40 4

tions as Ti = 1

From this we can say that in the basket, the num-
ber of apples are four times the number of bananas
Similarly the ratio of number of bananas to the number
of apples is 10 : 40.

i.e. 1:4 So We can say that in the basket the

me oS 10 1
In fraction form, we can write it as 40° 4

1
number of bananas are 4 th the number of apples.

We read it as | is to 4.
The comparison can also be done by using Percentage. There are two different methods to
find the percentage,

127

Page_Number 132 ended
/n
Page_Number 133 started
There are 40 apples out of 50 fruits in the
basket. So out of total fiuits, Ratio of apples we can also find it with the help of
40 Unitary method.
in the baskelt is [7+ to find the percent- Out of 50 fruits in the basket the
number of apples are 40,
age we have to make the denominator 100 So out of 100 fruits in basket the

40 40, 2_ 80

40
50 50 © 2 100 number of apples = = 100

Hence we can say that in the basket out of = 80.

total number of fruits, 80% are apples,

As basket contains only two fruits apples and bananas, so Percentage of apples + Percentage
of bananas = 100

i.e. 80 + Percentage of bananas = 100

So, Percentage of bananas = 100 — 80 = 20

So basket has 80% apples and 20% bananas.

Aliter : We can also find it as out of total 50 fruits in the basket, the number of bananas are

10

We often ask a student that how much percent of marks he/she got in his/her previous exam,
To further clear the concept, study the following examples ;
Example 7.1: Find the ratio of the following:
{i) Speed of cycle 20km/hour to speed of car 60 km/hour

(ii) Smto20m (iii) 50 paise to F 5
Sol. (i) Speed of cycle= 20km/h
Speed of car = 60km/h

Speed of cycle to the speed of car is 20 : 60,

; .. 20 1,
In fraction, we can write it as 6 3° 13

1
So, we can say that speed of cycle per hour is 3 rd the speed of car per hour.
(@i) Smto20 mis 5: 20.

Example 7.3: In a class, out of total students, 40% are boys. If boys are 12 in number
then find (i) Total students in the class (ii) number of girls in the class (iii) Ratio of
girls to boys of the class.

Sol. Let total number of students be x
So. as per question, 40% of x = 12

=> **7p9 — 12
so, v _ 12%100 _ 5
ar

(i) So total number of students in the class are 30.

(i) Number of girls = 30 — Number of boys = 30 — 12 = 18
fe z : 18 3
(ii) Ratio of girls to boys = 18: 12= PD 2

We can write it as 3 : 2 and read as 3 is to 2
Aliter : As we know that percent means out of 100. So 40% boys means, there are 40

100
boys out of 100 students. As boys are 12, so the total number of students are = i 12

= 30.
From the total number of students, we can find number of girls and the ratio of girls and
boys as we have done above.

Example 7.4 : A school organised a picnic for a class having 38 students. The picnic spot is 60
km away from the school. The transport company is charging at the rate of € 8 per
km. If two teachers are also going with the class and cost of refreshment is T3840.
Find (i) Cost per head (ii) If their first stop is 18 km from the school, then up to first
stop. what percent of total trip they have covered and what percent is left behind ?

(i) To find the cost per head, first, we have to find the total cost of trip.
Total cost of trip = Transport Charges + Refreshment Cost
= (60 « 2) » 8 + 3840
= 960 + 3840 = = 4800
‘Total Persons= ‘Total Students + Teachers

=38+2=40

So Cost per head= 4800 + 40 = 2120

Their first stop is at 18 km from school.

18
So percentage of distance covered out of total distance is = Po x 100 = 15%

and percentage of distance left = 100-15 = 85%
For remaining distance, we can also find it as
Remaining distance = 120 — 18 = 102km

102
So percentage = —— * 100 = 85%

7.2 Finding Discount :-

To attract customers or to promote the sale of goods, the companies often give discount, The
discount is reduction given on the Marked Price (M.P.), Marked Price is also known as List
Price and Discount = Marked Price (M.P.) — Selling Price (S.P.)

Discount
Marked Price
Example 7.5 : A shop gives 20% discount on the Marked Price. What would be selling

price of each of the following :
(i) A dress marked at & 300 (ii) A pair of shoes marked at 2 750
Sol. (@ Marked Price of dress = =300

Discount % = «100

an

Discount = 20% of = 300 = (30022

= =F 60
So Selling price of dress = Marked Price — Discount
= = 300 — = 60 = = 240
(ii) Marked Price of pair of Shoes = = 750

20
Discount = 20% of ¥ 750 = = (7502 |
100
= = 150
So Selling price of pair of shoes = Marked Price — Discount
= = 750 — = 150
=z 600

Example 7.6 : A Photoframe is marked at & 600 is sold for € 450. What is the discount and
discount percentage ?
Sol. We know, Discount = Marked Price (M.P.) — Selling Price (S.P.)

So Discount = %(600 — 450)
= F150
Discount'% =— Liu _x100 (AsDiscount is always on Marked Pr

7.3 Sales Tax

For the development of a country, Government requires money. Government collect this

money by implementing various types of taxes.

The sale tax is charged by the Government on the sale of an item, It is collected by the
shopkeeper from the customer and given to the government. Therefore, it is always on the
selling price of an item and is added to the value of the bill. Now a days Goods and Services

Tax (GST) is being levied on supply of goods and services.

Example 7.8 ; Find the buying price of each of the following when 5% sales tax is added

Sol.

to the purchase of

(i) A towel at [120

(ii) Pair of roller skates at 450

(ii) Price of Pair of Roller Skates = 7450
Sales tax = 5%
On 2100 the sales tax = &5

5
So on £450 the sales tax = z(735*450] = $22.50

So bill amount (Selling amount) = Cost of item + Sale Tax
= 2450 + 22.50
= 472.50

7.4 Simple Interest

Interest is the extra money paid by banks or post offices etc. on money deposited with them. If
people borrow money then also they have to pay interest. In class 7, you have already learnt how to
calculate simple interest. In this section, we will discuss about compound interest.

During your bank visit, you might have come across the statements like ‘‘one year interest for
FD (Fixed Deposit) in the bank @ 8% per annum or saving account with interest @ 4% per annum,
Let’s first revise concept of simple interest with following examples.

Example 7.10 : A sum of &5,000 is borrowed at a rate of 8% per annum for 2 years. Find
the simple interest and the amount to be paid at the end of 2 years.

Sol. You know how to find the simple interest, we have the formula

PxRxT

= ™ 100

Here, P = $5000, R = 8% per annum and T = 2 years.
where P means Principal (sum borrowed), R means Rate percent per year, T means time

So SIL = <(

5000x8x2

100 } = F800

Amount to be paid at the end of two years = Principal + $.I, = 75000 + 800
“. Amount = %5800

Aliter We can also find interest using Unitary Method, as under.

On 2100, interest charged for one year = T8

; 8
So on %5,000 interest charged for one year = | ~~ 5000 | = e400

100

Interest for two years = €400 x 2 = F800

2. At what rate of simple interest will a sum double itself in two years.

3. Find simple interest and amount to be paid on 715000 at 5% per annum after two years,
7.5 Calculating Compound Interest

Normally the interest paid or charged is never simple. The interesi is calculated on the
amount of previous year. This is known as interest compound or compound interest, [f
we have some money in our bank account, every year some interest is added to it,
which is shown in the pass book. This interest is not the same, each year it increases
(if we don't withdraw any amount from our account.)

Note that Principal remains same under simple interest while it changes year after year
under compound interest. In compound interest, amount at the end of first year becomes the
principal for second year, if it’s compounded annually.

Let us take an example and find the interest year by year. Each year our principal changes.

Example 7.11 : A sum of 75000 was borrowed by Sham for 2 years at an interest of 4%
compounded annually, Find the compound interest (C.L) and the amount Sham
has to pay at the end of 2 years.

Sol, Let us find simple interest for first year
Here P = $5000, R=4%p.a, T=1 year
. ; 5000 x4 x1
So simple interest after one year = & 700.) > 200
At the end of first year
Amount = Principal + Interest = 5000 + 7200 = %5200
In compound interest, the amount at the end of first year becomes the principal for second year,

5200 x41
Now interest for second year = oat 208

Now amount which has to be paid at the end of second year
= 25200 + F208
= 25408
Compound Interest = Amount — Principal
= F5408— T5000 = F408
Study the table given below, to find the difference between Simple and Compound Interest.

Principal 200.00 288.00
Third year Rate 20% p.a. 40,00 &57.60
Year end amount 280 + %40.00 2345.60

= 2320

Table 7.1

Note that in 3 years

Interest earned as simple interest = &320 — %200 = 120

whereas, Interest earned as Compound Interest = %345.60 — %200 = 2145.60

Note that the principal remains same under simple interest, whereas it changes year after
year under compound interest. At the end of year, first year amount becomes the second year
principal and so on.

7.6 Deducing a formula for Compound Interest

Under this section, we shall deduce a formula to find compound interest. You know al-
ready a formula to find simple interest.

Suppose P) is the principal on which interest is compounded annually at a rate of R% per

annum. After one year we have to find amount, we will denote the amount as A,, which will become
the principal for second year, that will be denoted as P, and so on,

Where A is amount, P is principal, R is rate of interest and T is time.
From this, we can find compound interest as CI, = A—P
Example 7.12 : Find the compound interest for 2 years at 5% per annum compounded
annually where principal is T10,500,
Sol. For compound interest we will calculate Amount first of all by using formula,

R -

(i) Growth and depriciation of value of an article.
(ii) Increase or decrease in population.
(iii) The growth of bacteria if rate of growth is known.
Example 7.13. The population of a town is 15,000. If it increases at the rate of 4% per
annum, then what will be the population after two years ?
Sol. As population increases at the rate of 4% per year, so every new year has new population,
Thus we can say it is increasing in compounded form.

Example 7.14. A second hand scooter was bought at a price of %24000. Its rate was de-
preciated by 5% per year. Find the yalue of scooter after two years. (Deprecia-
tion means reduction of value due to use and age of item.)

Sol. Here Price of Scooter (P) = 724000
Time = 2 years
Rate of depreciation = 5% per year

7.8 Financial Awareness
Mr Pritpal planned a dinner for his family, After having dinner, his younger daughter Tavleen,
a student of 8th class,anxiously asked her father that why had he paid more money than the actual
amount of food. Then Mr. Pritpal told her that we had to pay some taxes to the government which
is used for developing roads, infrastructure and educational institutions for us. There are mainly two
types of taxes - Direct Tax (levied on Income i.e. Income Tax, Wealth Tax)and Indirect Tax (levied
on items other than income). Tavieen was curious to know about these in detail. Mr. Pritpal in-
formed her that previously, we were mainly dealing with various indirect taxes such as Excise,
VAT and Sales Tax, which are different forms of consumer tax. However, the ways and form
in which they were levied on consumer, differed. Presently. many of these taxes have been
merged into a single tax called as GST.
GST (Goods & Services Tax)- GST came into effect from 1 July, 2017 through the 101th
amendment in the constitution of India by Government of India. The GST replaced the erst-

while multiple taxes levied by the Central and State Governments. It is an indirect tax or con-
sumption based tax used in India on the supply of goods and service. It is levied at every step in
the production process, but refunded to all the parties engaged in various stages of production
except the final consumer who actually bears the GST.

For collection, GST rates have been divided into five different tax slabs for collection of
tax: 0%, 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%, However, some products like petroleum, alcoholic drinks
and electricity are presently outside the purview of GST.

After explaining about GST, Mr. Pritpal showed her the restaurant bill in which 5% GST
was imposed on food ordered for dinner. Thereafter, Tavleen was quite happy to learn new

information.

In this section, we shall learn how to deposit and withdraw money from a bank account.
Depositing and Withdrawing Money :-

Operating a Current or Savings account is very easy, We can deposit and withdraw money
either by going to the bank or using an AIM. The same can also be done through internet and mobile
banking. Today we will learn the basic steps of depositing and withdrawing money at branch of a
bank.

Making a deposit :- If we want to deposit money into our bank account, we can use Cheque
or deposit slip, If we receive a cheque, we can deposit it with our bank through the clearing system
or we can make a deposit of money by bank deposit slip.

Filling deposit slip - Shweta went to a bank with her son Aryan.who studies in 8th class,
for depositing some money. Aryan was very excited as he was going first time in a bank. After
reaching at the bank, Shweta showed her some bank slips like deposit slips and withdrawal
slips and explained him about them in detail,

Firstly, she showed him a bank deposit slip and told him that a bank deposit slip is a small
piece of paper form that a person has to submit while depositing money into a bank account,
Bank deposit slip has two parts - the right side is for bank's use and left side is for depositor's
record,
Let us understand the details to be filled up on the Bank's copy. Most of the information Is
filled on right side,
Note:- No authorization is required for depositing money, anyone can deposit money into

anyone's account.
The main purpose of a deposit slip is that it tells the cashier that we have to deposit the
money in which bank account number.
Making a Withdrawal : To withdraw money we can write a cheque made out to ‘cash!
and then put date and sign it, we would deposit endorse the cheque and give it to the bank
employee, who will give us cash,

Bank Withdrawal Slips:-
After telling about bank deposit slips, she showed her bank withdrawal slips.

We can also withdraw the money through an ATM (Automated Teller Machine). To with-
draw money,put your ATM card into the machine, enter your PIN (Personal Identification Num-
ber) and specify the amount of cash you would like. Shweta further explained that nowadays
many people are using mobile phones and they can transfer funds from one account to another
and make payments.

Passbook :All these deposit and withdrawal entries are printed by the bank on a "Bank
Passbook" which is provided to us at the time of opening the account.

8.1 Meaning of Expressions (Introduction)

In earlier classes, we have learnt about algebraic expressions (or simply expressions). Alge-
braic expressions are formed by using variables and constants. Some examples of expressions are
2x+7, Txy-8, fx+5,y+8, x2+7 ete.

The expression 2x + 7 is formed with variable x and constants 2 and 7, where as the expression
Txy —8 is formed with variables x and y and constants 7 and 8, Similarly we can say about other
expressions.

8.1.1 Value of an Algebraic Expression

In expression, we can give any value to the variable or variables. The value of the expression
changes with the chosen value of the variable or variables, it contains. For example, in expression 2x
+7ifx=2 then 2x+7=2*2+7=11 and ifx =0 then 2x +7 =2 x 0+ 7=7 and so on. So
we can find different values of expression 2x + 7 for different values of the variable x.

8.1.2 Number line and an expression (in variable X)

Consider an expression x + 3. Let the position of variable x is X on number line (considering
x ta be +ve). So X may be any where on the number line to the right hand side of the origin. Now
place of x + 3 will be a point (say A) three units to the right of X.

0<—— >a A

147

Page_Number 152 ended
/n
Page_Number 153 started
Similarly, the place of x — 2 is two unit left of X.
Now if we want to find the position of 3x + 2 (taking x positive). The position of 3x (three times
x) will be at point B.
— —-—__o—___e—_____o—__->»

OX PY SAGX Be —2 6
So, position of 3x + 2 is two units right of B i.e at point C.
8.2 Terms, Factors and Coefficients:-

Term is either a single number or variable, or numbers and variables multiplied together. So 4, x,
4x and 4xy all are terms. Terms are added to form expressions.

Let us take three terms 4x, 3y and 8, From these three terms expression is 4x + 3y + 8. The
term 4x is product of 4 and x. 4 and x are factors of 4x. Whereas 3y is product of factors 3 and
y. The term 8 is made from single number 8.

The expression 9xy — 3x has two terms 9xy and —3x, The term 9xy is product of factors 9, x
and y. The term —3x is product of factors —3 and x. The numerical factor of a term is called its
numerical coefficient or simply coefficient. The coefficient in term 9xy is 9 and in —-3x is -3.

8.3 Monomials, Binomials,Trinomial
An expression containing one or more terms with real coefficients and variables having num-
ber whole as exponents is called a polynomial.
Examples of polynomials : 3x, 3x + 2y, x?+3x +5, ax+by+ez+d
@ Polynomial that contains: only one term is known as monomial.
e.g. 4, 3x, 4y, 7xy, 8x?y, —4xy?
® Polynomial that contains two terms is called a binomial.
e.g. 3x + 4y, x — 2y, ax + by
@ Polynomial having three terms is trinomial and so on.
e.g. x? —3x+ 5, ax + by + oz
8.4 Like and Unlike terms

Like terms are terms whose variables and their exponents are same (equal), The

21
coefficients can be different. So 3y, —4y, gy ue like terms. Similarly 3t? and —111? are like

terms, Also, 4ab, —-21ab and 11ab are like terms,
The terms which are not like are known as unlike terms. Here 7x and 4y are unlike
because variables are different. Similarly 7x? and 4x are unlike term because exponent are unequal.

8.5 Addition and Subtraction of Algebraic expressions

In earlier classes, we have learnt about addition and subtraction of algebraic expressions. Recall
that in addition we write each expression to be added in a separate row. While doing so, we write
like terms one below the other and add them.

148

Page_Number 153 ended
/n
Page_Number 154 started
Also subtraction of numbers is the same as addition of its additive inverse. Therefore subtracting
—4 is same as adding +4. Similarly, subtracting Sy is same as adding —Sy. Subtracting —3x? is same as
adding 3x? and so on, So in subtraction the sign of each term of the expression, to be subtracted, will
be changed. The signs in the third row written below each term in the second row help us in knowing
which operation has to be performed, Observe the following examples to clear the concept,
Example 8.1. Add the following expression
(ij) x+y—2zand 2x-2y + 3z
(i) 2x+3y—4zandx+y-—4
(ii) 7xy+ 5yz—3zx, 4xy + 7zx and 3yz+4
Sol. Write the expression in separate rows with like terms one below the other, we have
(i) x+y -2z
2x -2y+3z
3x-y + z
(ii) 2x + By —4z
x+ y -4
3x+4y—4z-4
there is no like terms of —4z and—4
(iil) Txy + Syz—3zx
Axy + 72K
3yz +4
“Tixy + 8yz + 4zx +4
Example 8.2. Subtract
(i) Sa? —3ab + 4b — 7 from 8a? — 3b*- 8ab + 9a — 7b
(i) x+3y 42+ x?—y* from 8x + 5z—x?-y?#+7
Sol. Like addition, we will write the expression in separate rows with like terms one below the

other and then we will subtract
@) 8a? — 3b? Bab +9a — 7b fi) 8x+5z—- 2 -y +7
Sa? —3ab +4b -7 x-42 + x -y +3y
= + =: =+ -—- + =
3a?— 3b? -— Sab +9a —11lb+7 7x +9z — 2x? + 7-3y

Example 8.3. Subtract x + 3y — 52 + 7 from the sum of the expressions 2x — 3y + 4z —2 and
—3x + Sy + 122-4
Sol. First, we will add the expressions 2x — 3y + 4z — 2 and —3x + 8y + 12z —4, as we did

earlier

2x-—3y+ 4z-2 Now subtract x + 3y—5z+7 from —x + Sy + 16z-6
— 3x + 8y +12z —4 —x + Sy + 16z-6

To find total number of dots
we have to multiply number of
rows to the number of columns

eeee---¢@ m*n
eee ete Here number of rows are m
and number of columns are n

(m+ 1) (a+ 1)
Here number of rows are
(m + 1) and number of col-
unis are (n + 1)

(ii) Let us think of some other situations in which
two algebraic expressions have to be multiplied?
We know the area of rectangle is ¢ x b where ,,
£ is length and b is breadth of rectangle.
If length of rectangle is increased by 2 units
and breadth is reduced by 1 unit then area of
new rectangle will be (¢ + 2) = (b— 1)

(iii) For buying things we have to multiply number of things with their unit price.

In all the examples discussed above we need to multiply quantities in the form of algebeic
expressions, so now we will learn, how to multiply algebraic expressions, First we will
learn multiplication of monomial with another monomial.

8.7 Multiplying a Monomial by a Monomial
8.7.1 Multiplying two Monomials
We know multiplication is repeated addition

as 4x3 means 4 times 3
ie, 4x3 = 3+3+3+3=12
Similarly 4x (Sy) = Sy + 5y + 5y + Sy = 20y
and § x (3x) = 3x+3x+3x+3x+3x = 15x
Now observe some following products:-
@) yx3x = yx3xx = 3xxxy=3xy
@i) Sxx4y = Sxxx4xy = 5% 4xxx y=20xy
= 3xxx(-2)xy = 3x (-2)*xxy=-6xy

(ii) 3x x (-2y)
Note that product of two monomials is a monomial
Now observe some following examples
(vy) 5xx3x? = §xxx3xx?
= (5x3)*(x*x) = 15 «x3 = 15x3

Here we will use the rules of exponents and powers that for any non zero integer a, a™ =

a = amt 5

(¥) Sx? « (4xtyz) = (5 * -4) * ("x x4) x (yz)

= -20 x’yz

8.7.2 Multiplying three or more monomials

Observe the following examples
(i) 2x x 3y x 4z= (2x 3y) x 4z = 6xy = 4z = 24xyz
Gi) 2xy « Sxy? « 6xy? = (xy  Sxty2) « 6xy?
= 10x8y? = 6xy?
= (10 x 6) xty? * xy?
= 60 (x? « x) x (y* * y?) = 60xty?
It is evident that first of all we multiply first two monomials and answer obtained is multi-
plied with third monomial to get the final answer.
Note: We can multiply the monomials in any order, result will be same.

3x Sy 3x * Sy=(3 * 5) * x * y= I5xy
4x 2x 4x * 2x = (4 2) x (x X x) = 8x?
2xy 3x 2xy x 3x = (2 x 3) x (KX x) x y= Ox’y

Example 8.5. Find the yolume of cubiod (rectangular box) whose length, breadth and height are

&

respectively

(i) 2x, 3y, 4z

(ii) 2ax, 3by, 7ez

(iii) 2pq. 3qr, 4rp

We know volume of cuboid =/* b * b

So volumes of rectangular boxes (cuboid) are

(i) 2x x 3y x 4z=(2 x 3 * 4) & (x) * (y) * (z) = 24xyz

(i) 2ax x 3by * 7oz=(2 x 3 x 7) * (ax) * (by) * (cz) = 42abexyz

(ii) 2pq x 3qr x 4rp = (2 x 3 x 4) * (p x p) x (qx q) * (Xt) = 24p'q’t?

8.8 Multiplying a monomial by a polynomial
8.8.1 Multiplying a monomial by a binomial
Let us multiply mononial 4x by binomial (5x + 2y)
ie. Find 4x * (5x + 2y)
Here we will use the distributive law for this multiplication.
So 4x * (5x+2y) = (4x « 5x) + (4x « 2y)

= 20x? + 8xy
Here observe that product of monomial and binomial is a binomial
Similarly (-4x) x (-Sy+2x) = (-4x x —Sy) + (4x * 2x)
= 20xy — 8x?

Note:- If we multiply a binomial with a monomial, we will again get a binomial. We can use
commutative law for this multiplication.

For example (a—7b) * 2b
= 2b « (a-7b)
= 2b x at 2b x (-7b) = 2ba — 14b?
or 2ab—14b?—[-.- ab = ba]

Sa (a?+2a+3) =(5a x a’) + (Sa x 2a) + (5a * 3)
= 5a’ + 10a? + 15a

Now for y=-3 ; We have = 6 (-3)? — 16 x (-3)-3
=6x9+48-3
= 54+ 48-3 =99
Example 8.7, Add
(i) 2y (5—y) and 6y? + l4y + 7
(ii) 3x (x? + 2x — 5) and 2 (x* + 7x — 2)
Sol. (@ First expression = 2y (5 — y) = 2y x 5-—2y x y= 10y— 2y? =— 2y? + 10y

8.9 Multiplying a Polynomial by a Polynomial
8.9.1 Multiplying a binomial by a binomial

Let us multiply one binomial (3a + 3b) with another binomial (7a + 4b). As we did in earlier
cases, we will use distributive law to find the multiplication

(3a + 3b) * (7a + 4b) 3a * (Ja + 4b) + 3b * (7a + 4b)
(3a « 7a) + Ga x 4b) + (3b = 7a) + (3b =< 4b)

{After doing product of 2 polynomials, we need to look for like terms and must combine
them to get result.]

(ii) (2x —y) and (x + 3y)

8.8.2 Multiplying a Binomial by a trinomial
In this multiplication, we shall have to multiply each of the two terms of binomials by each of the
three terms of trinomial. We will get total 6 terms. which may reduce to § or less, if like terms
appears in multiplication. Consider
(2x + 3y) x (x + 2y +5) = 2x * (x +2y +5) +3y (x + 2y + 5) (using distributive law)

8.10 What is an Identity ?
Consider the equality (x—5) (x+1) =x? —4x—5 We will solve both sides of equality for same
value of x say x = 7.
for x=7, LHS = (7-5)(7+1)=2*8=16
RHS (72—4* 7-5 =49-28-5
=49—33
= 16
So for x =7 the values of the two sides of equality are same

Let us take a new value x =—3
LHS = (-3 -— 5) (3 + 1) =-8 * -2=16
RHS = (-3 —4(-3)-5 = 9+12-5=16
Thus for x = -3; LHS = RHS
We find that for any value of x, LHS = RHS.
Any equality which is true for every value of variable in it, is called an identity,
So (x—5) (x +1) =x? — 4x — 5 is an identity.
Difference between an identity and equation
Consider an equation x?— 5x+6=0
Now for x=1
LHS =(1?-5*1+6=1-5+6=7-5=2

RHS =0
LHS # RHS
For x, =2
LHS = (2? -5x2+6=4-10+6=10-10=0
RHS =0
LHS =RHS
For x =3
LHS = (3) -5*3+6=9-15+6=15-15=0
RHS =0
LHS =RHS
For x =0

160

Page_Number 165 ended
/n
Page_Number 166 started
LHS =(0P -5x0+6=6
RHS =0
LHS #RHS

We observe that equation x*-5x+6=0 is true for x = 2 and 3 only and is not true for any other
value of x,

We can say that equation is true for some specific values of variables only i.e. it is not true for
all values of variable involved in it. Therefore it is not an identity.

8.11 Standard Identities
Now we shall study three identities which are very useful, The identities are obtained by actual
multiplication of a binomial with same or another binomial.
(a) Let us first consider (a + b) (a +b) or (a + b)}*
Now (a + b)? = (a + b) (a + b)

=a(at+b)+b(at+b)
= a+ab+ba+b?
= a? + 2ab + b* (-- ab = ba)

So (a + b}? = a? + 2ab +b? ()
We can verify the above identity with different values of a and b, The values of two sides
will be same.

(b) Now consider (a—b)*
(a—b? =(a—b)(a—b) =a(a—b)—b(a—b)
=a? —ab—ba+b? = a*— 2ab + b?
So (a — b)? = a? — 2ab + b? (II)
(c) Now consider (a + b) (a—b)
Now (a+b) (a—b) = a(a—b)+b(a—b)
= a?—ab + ba — b?
So (a + b) (a—b) a? — b? (11)
The above three identities (I), (ID) and (IIT) are known as standard Identities.
(d) Now we shall discuss one more useful identity
(x + a) (x+b)= x (x+b)+a(x+b)
= x?+ bx+ ax + ab
= x?+(at+b)x+ab
or (x + a) (x +b) =x? + (a+b) x+ab (TV)

= 102,01

In this chapter, you will learn
To Differentiate between plane figures (triangles, quadrilaterals,
pentagoes etc.) and solid figures.
Yo find perimeter and area of plane figures (quadrilaterals).
To find area of polygon.
To find surface area and volume of some solids. (Cuboid, Cube,
Cylinder) and use the concept in daily life.

9.1 Introduction

In earlier classes we have learnt about the perimeter and area of some closed plane figures. The
perimeter of a figure is the total length of its boundary and the area of a figure is the region enclosed
by it. We have already learnt about the perimeter and area of some plane figures such as triangles,
rectangles, squares and circles etc, We have also learnt to find the area of pathways or borders of
rectangular shapes,

In this chapter we will lean to find the area of simple quadrilaterals and some special types of
quadrilaterals. We will also learn about surface area and volume of solids like cuboid, cube, cylinder
ete,

9.2 Let us Recall

To review the previous knowledge let us recall the geometrical shapes and formulae (expressions)
to find their perimeter and area.

Example 9.2 The length and breadth of a rectangular field are in 3:2. If the area of the field
is 294m’, Find the cost of fencing the field at <8 per metre.

Sol. Let the length be 3x and breadth be 2x.

Given, Area of rectangle = 294 m?
ie. length « breadth = 294
=> 3x x 2x =294
=> 6x2 = 294
= x =49

x? = 7

length =3x=3 x7=2im
And breadth =2x=2 x 7= 14m
Now, Perimeter of the rectangle = 2 (¢ + b)
=2 (21+ 14)=2.* 35 = 70m
The cost of fencing the field = 2(70x8) = 2560
Example 9.3 A park is rectangular in shape having length |@|

(Here note that area of floor is given in m* unit where as the size of tile is given in cnY unit.
So to find the number of tiles, we have to convert them in same units.)

Area covered by one tile = b x h = (24 x 10) cm? = 240 cm?

9.3 Area of a Quadrilateral

We know that a quadrilateral is a polygon having four sides. A quadrilateral can be split into two
triangles by drawing one of its diagonal. It is known as triangulation. This “triangulation” helps us to

Sol. Figure 9.14 (i) and (ii) are both of trapezium shape.
(i) Given parallel sides a = 30 m, b = 40 m and distance between them (h) = 20 m

Area of trapezium = 2 (a+b) xh

(ii) Given parallel sides a= 20 m, b = 30 m and distance (h) = 10m

So Area of trapezium = 2 (20 + 30) x 10 = 250 m?.

Example 9.13. The area of a trapezium shaped field is 480 m?*. The distance between two
parallel sides is 15 m. If one of the parallel side is 20 m. Find the other parallel
side.

Sol. Here one of the parallel side of trapezium = 20 m.
Let another parallel side be b, Distance between parallel sides (h) = 15 m
and Area of trapezium = 480 m?

Now using, area of trapezium = 3“ (sum of parallel sides) * h

9.5 Area of a Polygon

We know that a simple closed figure made up of only line segments is called a polygon. So far
we have learnt about the area of three sided polygons i.e. triangles and four sided polygon i.e.
quadrilaterals, Now we will try to find the area of a five sided polygon namely pentagon, six Sided
polygon namely hexagon and so on.

By Joining the diagonals, we have divided a quadrilateral into triangles and found its area,
Similar methods can be used to find the area of a polygon. Observe the following pentagon,

E
Figure 9,17 Figure 9.18
In fig. 9.17 by constructing two diagonals AC and AD the pentagon ABCDE is divided into
three paris.
So Area of ABCDE = Area of AABC + Area of AACD + Area of AAED
We can find area of ABCDE in another way also.

In fig. 9.18, by constructing one diagonal AD and three perpendiculars BF, CG and EH on it,
Pentagon ABCDE is divided into four parts. So area of ABCDE = area of right angled triangle AFB
+ Area of trapezium BFGC + Area of Right angled triangle CGD ~ Area of triangle AED.

Example 9.15. Find the area of the Pentagon shown in figure 9.19, Cc
Sol. Here pentagon ABCDE is divided into
tight triangle AFB, trapezium BFHC,

right triangle CHD and triangle AED. A

Cylinder Pyramad

Figite 9. 32

Observe that some shapes have two or more than two identical (congruent) faces. In case of cuboid
all six faces are rectangular and opposite faces are identical, So there are three pairs of identical faces,

In case of a cube, all six faces are square and all are identical whereas cylinder has one curved
surface and two circular faces which are identical and parallel to each other.

Observe in cylinder. the line segment joining the centre of circular faces is perpendicular to the
base (fig. 9.32). Such cylinders are known as right circular cylinders. We are going to study only
this type of cylinder though there are other types of cylinders as well.

9.7 Surface Area of Cuboid, Cube and Cylinder

To find the total surface area of cube, cuboid and cylinder, we will find the area of each face. The

surface area of a solid is the sum of the area of its faces. To clarify further, we take each shape one by one.

9.7.2 Cube

We know that if length, breadth and height of a
cuboid are equal then it is known as a cube. All faces of
a cube are square in shape. All faces are of equal area.
Lateral surface Area = 4 = Area of one face = 47
And Total surface area of cube = 6 * Area of one face

15m*10m*7m. From each can of paint, 100m* of area can be painted. How many
cans of paint will he need to paint the room?

Sol. Dimensions of the hall are 15m * 10m * 7m
Since, he is painting walls and ceiling
Surface area of the hall =Area of four walls + Area of top

=2 (é+b) h+ eb
= 2 (15+10) x 7+ 15 x 10
=2 x 25 x 7+ 150 = 350 + 150 = 500m?

= Surface Area ofthe hall =500m*

Given, Area to be painted with 1 can = 100m*

Number of Cans = —~ =

Thus, 5 cans of paint will be needed to paint the room.
Example 9.23 What will happen to the surface area of the cube if its edge is doubled?
Sol, Let the edge of the cube be /
then, Surface Area of the cube = 67?
Now, If the edge is doubled, i.e. new edge = 2/
Surface area 6 (2£)? = 4 (622) —4 x (Original surface area)

Thus, If edge of a cube is doubled then the total surface area will be four times the
original surface area.

Total surface area of box (a) =2 (4b = bh+ he)
= 2 (60 x 40 + 40 x 20 + 20 x 60) cm?

Total surface area of box (b) = 67 = 6 x 50 * 50 = 15000 cm?

So box (a) requires lesser amount of material to make.

circular cylinders, For example, water pipes, tube lights, round pillars etc.
To find the surface area of the cylinder, cut a cylinder as shown in figure 9.39.
Curved surface area of a cylinder is the area of its curved part, part of cylinder is formed
from a rectangle having length 2mr and width h. So curved surface area of a cylinder is 27h,

To find the total surface area of a cylinder by an activity.
Material scala Chart paper, Geometry box, Coloured sketch or Pencils.

1. Take a ciate paper and draw a net of closed
cylinder as shown in which we have a rectangle of
size 22cm = 14cm and two congruent circles of
radius 3.5cm each.

Cut the net from the chart paper.

Now, when rectangle is rolled along
sidel4cm,there is formation of an open cylinder
and height of cylinder will be 14cm.

Close the open cylinder from top and bottom with
two congruent circles of radius 3.5cm (whose

22
circumference = 2mr = 2 > * 3.5 =22cm)

5. Thus, A closed cylinder is formed by suitable transformation.
Observation:
Total Surface of Area of a cylinder = Area of the given net a closed cylinder
= Area of Rectangle + 2 « Area of circle
= 22cm « 14cm + 2 x nr?
= (2mr) x h + 2m?

Example 9.26 Find the total and curved surface area of cylinder shown in figure 11.40.
Sol. Radius (r) of base of cylinder is 2 m and height

9.8 Volume of Cuboid, Cube and Cylinder

Amount of space occupied by a three
dimensional object is called its volume. We
can compare the volume of objects
surrounding us. Volume ofa room is greater
than the volume of a almirah kept inside it.
Similarly volume of almirah is greater than a
box kept inside it.

Remember to find the area of a region
We use square units. Here we will use cubic
units to find the volume of a solid. For finding
the area we divide the region into square
units. Similarly to find the volume of a solid
we need to divide it into cubical units.

Observe that the volume of each of the

adjoining solid is 8 cubic units, (Figure 9.44) Figure 9.44

We can say that the volume of a solid is measured by counting the number of unit cubes it
contains, Cubic units which are generally use to measure volume are
1 cubic cm = 1 cm * 1 cm x 1 cm= 1 cm®
leubicm =~1m*1lm*1m= 1m
lcubicmm = 1 mm x 1 mm « 1 mm = Imm?
Now we find some expressions to find volume of a cuboid, cube and cylinder.
9.8.1 Cuboid

Take 36 cubes of equal size (7.e. length of each cube is same), Arrange them to form a cuboid,
You can arrange them in many ways as shown in the following table :

Page_Number 201 started
What do we observe ?
As we used 36 cubes to form these cuboids, so volume of each cuboid is 36 cubic units. We

can see that volume of each cuboid is equal to product of length, breadth and height of the
cuboid.

So Volume of Cuboid =/ * b « h
As / = b is the area of base, so we can also say that
Volume of Cuboid = area of base * height
Example 9.32 Find the volume of cuboid shown in figure 9.45. (a) and 9.45 (b)

—ir puna,
yi ©)

(a) Figure 9.45
Sol. In figure 9.45 (a) length, bredath and height of cuboid is 8 cm, 2 cm and 2 cm respectively,
So Volume of Cuboid = / * b x h=(8 * 2 * 2) cm*
= 32 cm?
In figure 9.45 (b), Area of base of Cuboid is 18 cm? and height is 3 cm.
So Volume of Cuboid = Area of base = height = (18 x 3) cm? = 54 cm?
9.8.2 Cube
As we know that cube is a special case of cuboid, where /=b=h.
Hence Volume of Cube =/x /x/=F ice. (side)

Example 9.33. Find the volume of cube having side (i) 5 em (ii) 2.5 em.
Sol. Weknow Volume of cube = (side)?
(i) Side = 5cm
Volume = (5)? = 125 cm?
(ii) Side = 2.5em

196

Page_Number 201 ended
/n
Page_Number 202 started
Volume = (2.5) = 15.625 cm?
Example 9.34 Find the height of a cuboid whose base area is 180 cm? and volume is
900 cm’.
Sol. Given, Volume of Cuboid = 900 cm?
and its base area = 180 cm? ; Let h cm be the height of cuboid.

We know that
Volume of Cuboid = Base Area * height
So 900 = 180 xh
j h= oo 5
ie. = Tg9 ~ 30

Example 9.35 A cuboid is of dimensions 60 cm x 54 cm x 30 cm. How many small cubes of
side 6 cm can be placed in the given cuboid ?
Sol. Volume of cuboid = (60 « 54 = 30) cm? = 97200 cm?
Volume of a small cube = (6 < 6 * 6) cm = 216 cm?

Volume of Cuboid 97200 —

.. Number of small cubes that can be placed in the cuboid = Volume ofCube 216

9.8.3 Cylinder

In case of cuboid we have seen that volume of cuboid =/* b x h

Also we have seen that volume of cuboid = Area of base = height

Can we find the volume of a cylinder in the same way ?

Like cuboid, top and bottom of a cylinder are congruent and parallel to each other. Its curved
surface is also perpendicular to the base, just like cuboid.

So the Volume of Cylinder = Area of base = height
=nr< h=mrh

where r is the radius of circular face and his the height of cylinder.

Example 9.36 Find the volume of cylinder shown in figure 9.46 (a) and 9.46 (b)

Page_Number 203 started
Sol. In figure 9.46 (a), radius (r) of base = 7 cm and height (h) of cylinder = 10 cm

22
So Volume of cylinder = mr%h = SORE cm?
= 1540 cm?
In figure 9.46 (b), Area of base of cylinder = 154 m? and height of cylinder = 4 m,
So Volume of cylinder = Area of base = height

= (154 x 4) m? = 616 m3
9.9 Volume and Capacity

Volume refers to the amount of space occupied by an object and capacity refer to the quantity
that a container holds. For example if a water bottle holds 1000 cm* of water, then the capacity of
the water bottle is 1000 cm’.

Capacity is also measured in terms of litres. The relation between litre and cm* is 1 mé= 1 em*;
1L = 1000 cm’.

Now 1 m1 = (100 « 100 x 100) cm? = 1000000 cm? = 1000L

Example 9.37 A milk tank is in the form of a cylinder whose radius is 1.5 m and length is
7 m. Find the quantity of milk in litres that can be stored in the tank ?
Sol. Volume of milk tank = mh

~ (Fxtsx1sx7} m

= 49.5 m? = 49.5 x 1000/ [-. lm? = 1000/]
= 49500 /
Example 9.38 A rectangular piece of paper 11 cm x 4 cm is folded without overlapping to
make a cylinder of height 4 cm. Find the volume of cylinder.

Sol. Length of the paper becomes the circumfrence of the base of the cylinder and width be-
comes the height of cylinder.

Let radius of cylinder =r cm and height = 4 cm
Now perimeter of the base of cylinder = circumference of circle
=> 2rr=11

10.1 Introduction

In earlier classes, we have already learnt about powers with positive integers as exponents,
expressing the natural numbers as a product of prime factors.

For example 26= 2%2%2*2x2x2

We say : 2 raised to power 6. Here we say 2 raised
Here, 2 is called base and 6 is called exponent. to the power 6.

10.4.1 Uses of Exponents to express numbers in standard form

First we shall discuss that, how to express very large number in standard form. For example,
{i) Mass of earth is 5970, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000. 000, 000
= 5.97 x 10#
(Here decimal is moved 24 places to left)
(i) Distance of earth to the sun is 149, 600, 000km
= 1.496 = 10%km
(Here decimal is moved 8 places to left)

It is clear from above examples that any number can be expressed as a decimal number be-
tween | and 10 (including 1 but excluding 10) multiplied by a power of 10, such a form of number
is called standard form, In the same manner, we can express very small numbers in standard form.
For Example

(i) Take a small number 0.00000005

We have
0.00000005 = —_— as = 5x10 (Here decimal is moved 8 places to the right)
100000000 10°
(i) The size of a plant cell is 0,00001275m
1275 1275. (1.275
~ 100000000 10°10" 10°
= 1,275 x 105m (Here decimal is moved 5 places to right)

From the above discussion we find that very small numbers can be expressed in standard
form by shifting the decimal to the night.

Example 10.10.Write the following numbers in standard form.

(iii) 6020000000000000 = 6.02 = 10!%
10.4.2 Conversion from standard form number to usual decimal form
In last section, we have learnt about the standard form of numbers. In this section, we shall
discuss the conversion of standard form in usual form. Let us consider some examples:-
Example 10.11 Express the following numbers in usual form
(i) 4.63 * 108 (ii) 7.89 x 10 (iii) 5x10#

463
Solution () 4.63 x 10*= 70! = 463x10* = 4630000

10.4.3 Comparing very large very small numbers :
Example 10.12. Compare the following:
(i) Weight of A is 2.34 * 10°kg and weight of B is 1.17 * 10° kg
(ii) Number 8.02 x 10% and 0.802 x 10°

Weightof A 2,34x10? 2.3410?

02 x107 02107
(ii) Ratio = CORI = 8.02 x =107=100

0.80210 — 8.02107
*. First number is 100 times the second number.

Example 10.13. Find the total mass if mass of hydrogen element is 1.674*107’kg and mass
of sliver element is 1.79x10*kg ?

Sol. Total mass = Mass of Hydrogen element + Mass of silver element
= 1.674 x 1077+ 1.79 x 10°°= 1.674 x 107x105 + 1.79 x10%
= 0.01674 x 10% + 1.79 x 10°
= (0.01674 + 1.79) * 105 = 1.80674 = 10%

Direct and Inverse Proportions

In this chapter you will learn:
* About direct and inverse proportions.

+ About various terms like demand and supply.
* About Growth in population and land available and other daily life
problems.

11.1 Introduction:-

In our day to day life, we come across many such situations where variation in one quantity
brings variation in other quantity, For example,

1, Ifthe number of articles (of same kind) purchased increases, the total cost also increases,

2. More the money deposited in a bank, more will be the interest.

3. With increase in speed of a vehicle, the time taken to cover the same distance will decrease.

4. More the number of workers, less time will be taken to complete the same work.

Obserye that change in one quantity leads to change in other quantity. Consider an example,
Aman prepares tea for herself She uses 200 m/ of water, 1 spoon of sugar, half spoon of tea leaves
and 30ny/ of milk. How much quantity of each item will she need to make tea for five persons?

To answer such type of questions,we now study concept of variation in which we shall discuss
two types of variation or proportion i.e. direct and inverse.
11.2 Direct Proportion

Two quantities are said to be in direct proportion when increase in one quantity (variable) leads to
increase in other quantity (variable) in same ratio or when decrease in one quantity leads to decrease in other
quantity in same ratio. Consider if cost of Ikg of sugar is £20 then what would be the cost of 4kg sugar?

We see that cost of 4 kg sugar is 4 times cost of lkg of sugar. The cost will be 4 x 20= 80.

“. Increase in quantity of sugar (i.e. 1 kg to 4kg) leads to increase in the cost of sugar (i.e,
20 to F80). So these quantities (variables) are in direct proportion.

Similarly cost of 6kg sugar will be 7120 and 10 kg of sugar wil be 7200,

Study the following table

Weight of sugar (in kg)

Page_Number 220 started
Observe that as weight of sugar increases its cost also increases in such a manner that their ratio
remains same,

In above example, Ratio =

Consider one more example. Let the mileage of a car is 21km/litre. How far will it travel in 10
litres? The answer is 210km. How did we calculate it? Since in one litre tt travel 21 kms, So in 10
litres, it will travel (21 x 10) =210 kms. Similarly in 20 litres it will travel (21 x 20) kms =420 kms,
Let the consumption of petrol be x litres and corresponding distance travelled is y km then complete
the following table,

EL Od

Beet! Sl al a al

x
As the value of x increases, the value of y also increases. In such a way that the ratio y does

1
not change; it remains constant (say k). In this case, it is 21°

We say x and y are in direct proportio
a
In this example, m1 21040

Where in numerator 1, 10, 20.... is the petrol consumed in litres (x) and in denominator 21, 210,
420, .... is the corresponding distance travelled in kms (y). So when x and y are in direct proportion

Xi x
we can write es Pa where y, and y, are the values of y corresponding to the values x, and x, of x
1 2 Ms -

respectively.

The consumption of petrol and the distance travelled by a car is a case of direct proportion.
Similarly the total amount spent and the number of articles purchased of same kind is also an ex-
ample of direct proportion.

Now observe the following example. Let the present age of a boy, his father and mother are
15years, 45 years and 40 years respectively. Make the following table

Present Age after Age after
Age Five years | ten years

15 20 2 25

5

215

Page_Number 220 ended
/n
Page_Number 221 started
Similarly you can make a table to find the ratio of his age to the corresponding age of his mother,

Now what do you observe? Do B and F increases (or decreases) together? The answer will be yes.
B

NowIs = F (ratio) same everytime? The answer is No. So they are not in direct proportion. You

can repeat this activity with other fies and write down the observations.
| decreasing) together need not always be in direct proportion

Example 11.6 A machine in a soft drink factory fills 840 bottles in 6 hours. How many

Now we put the given information in the form of a table as shown below:
Number of Bottles | s4o [x]

More the number of bottles, more time will be taken. So both terms are in direct propor-

tion.
840 x

Thus, 700 bottles will be filled in 5 hours

So, the distance shown on map will be 4 cm.
Example 11.8 If the weight of 12 sheets of a paper is 36 grams, how many sheets of the

Thus, the number of sheets of papers weighing 300 grams be 100.

11.3 Inverse proportion:-

Two quantities (variables) are said to be in inverse proportion if mcrease in one quantity leads to
decrease in other quantity in same ratio or vice-versa. For example, (i) If the number of workers
increases, time taken to finish the same work decreases. (ii) if the speed of a vehicle increases, the
time taken to cover the same distance decreases,

Let us consider an example. A school wants to spend %6000 on mathematics books, If the
rate of one book is €40, then how many books could be bought? Clearly 150 books can be bought.
Tf the price of book is more than $40, then the number of books which could be purchased with the
same amount of money will be less than 150, Observe the following table.

Note: The product of the corresponding values of two quantities is fixed constant ie.

If we represent the price of one book as x and number of books purchased as y, then as x
increases, y decreases in same ratio and vice versa. It is important to note that the product xy
remains fixed constant.

Sol. We know, if and y are in inverse proportion then x,y, =x,y,

(i) Here x, = 12, x, = 36, y,=15.y,=5
x, y, = 12 x 15 = 180 and x, y, = 36 x 5 = 180
=> xX,y,—x, y, = 180
Thus x and y are in inverse proportion.
@) Here x, = 18, x, =54,y,=27. y,=12
X, Y, = 18 x 27 = 486 and x, y, = 54 = 12 = 648

Sol. Let the number of men required to build the wall in 30 hours be ‘a’.
We have the following table:

(Number ofmen [15 | a]

Obviously, more the number of men, less the number of hours required to build the wall,

Sol. Let the required time to fill the tank be x, and x, minutes corresponding to 6 pipes and 12
pipes.
Thus we have the following table lhour = 60 min
SE 2hours = 60 » 2

As number of pipes decreases, time taken ae increases ~ as the number of pipes
increases, the time taken will decreases, so this is case of inverse proportion.

(i) 8x 120 = 12 x x,

Thus, time taken by 12 pipes to fill the tank is 80 minutes i.e. 1 hour and 20 minutes.

Example 11.16. There are 100 students in a hostel. Food provision for them is for 21 days.
Out of 100, 25 students have gone to their home for one month. How long will the
provision of food last for the remaining students?

Sol. Suppose the provision last for y days when the number of students remains 100 — 25 =
75. we have the following table

Number of students } 100 | 75 |
Number of days 21 y

Notice that it is a case of inverse proportion
So 100x21=75 xy

100 = 21

hence y —
Thus, the provision will last for 28 days.

CHAPTER

Factorisation

In this chapter, you will learn:

* About factors of algebraic expressions.
+ How to make factors.
+ About different methods of factorisation.

12.1 Introduction

In earlier classes, we have learnt about factors of composite numbers, let us consider a natural
number, (say)

42 = 1x42 Here 1 and 42 are factors of 42.
Or 42 = 1x22] Here 1, 2 and 21 are factors of 42.
Or 42 = 1x2x3x7 Here 1, 2, 3 & 7 are factors of 42.
As we know that | is neither composite nor prime number.

Therefore 2, 3, 7 are prime factors of 42. Similarly the prime factors of 30 are 2, 3, & 5
and the prime factors of 70 are 2, 5, & 7.

Similarly algebraic expressions can also be expressed as the product of their factors.

12.2 Factors of Algebraic Expression:

Tn Class VII, we have learnt that terms of algebraic expressions are formed as product of
factors. For example, in algebraic expressions 3xy, the
term 3xy is formed by factors 3, x and y i.e. 3xy = 3xxxy
here 3, x and y are factors of 3xy.

We observe that these factors 3x & y of 3xy which
further cannot be expressed as.a product of factors, called
‘Irreducible factors’.

Note that 3=(xy) is not irreducible form of 3xy. Since
the factor xy can be further expressed as a product of x
and y i.e. xy =xxy

Let us consider the expression 5x (x+3).

It can be written as a product of factors 5, x and (x+3) Le, Sx (x+3) = 5 * x x (x +3)

Similarly Irreducible factors of 12x (y+3) (z+5) are 2, 2, 3, x, (y+3) and (z+5)

Also, the product of 2x+3 and 2x-3 = (2x + 3) (2x-3) = 4x° - 9

We can say that 2x+3 and 2x~3 are factors of 4x*-9. we can write it as 4x*-9= (2x+3) (2x-3)

Since 3xy can also be written as
1x3xxxy, Note | is a factor of 3xy.
Infact | is a factor of every term.

But we do not show | as a sepa-
rate factor of any term, unless it is
specially required,

12.3 What is Factorisation

As we have learnt, when an algebraic expression can be written as product of two or more
expressions then each of these expression is called a factor of the given expression. To find factors of
a given expression means to obtain two or more expressions whose product is the given expression,

The process of writing an algebraic expression as the product of two or more algebraic expres-
sions is called factorisation. Thus, factorisation is the reverse process of multiplication.

For Example

Product of 5xy and (3xy—7) is Sxy (3xy — 7) = 15x’y?-35xy and factors of 15x*y? — 35xy are Sxy
and (3xy-7)

Similarly product of (2a+3b) and (2a~3b) is (2a + 3b) (2a — 3b) = 4a’—9b’ and factors of 4a7—
9b* are 2a + 3b and 2a — 3b.

Now we shall learn the factorisation of expressions by different methods.
12.3.1 Method of finding Common Factors

In this section, we shall learn about how to take out the common factor (s) and use the Distribu-

tive property
ab+ac =axb+a xc
=ax(b+c)
=a(b+c)

Example 12.1. Factorise : 2x+6

Solution- We shall write each term as a product of irreducible factors.
Here 2x=2%*x and 6=2x3
Hence 2x + 6=2*x+2x3
Observe that both terms have ‘2’ as common factor.
2.2K 46 = 2% (+3) =2 (+3)

Example 12.2. Factorise : 7a* + 14a

Solution;- Here 7a?=7=xaxa and l4a=2x7xa
Observe that both terms have ‘7’ and ‘a’ as common factors
Hence 7a?+ 14a = 7xaxat+2x7xa

7Txax(at2)

Ta (a+ 2)

Example 12.3. Factorise : 5x*y — 15xy?

Solution : We know 5x’¥y = 5xxxxxy and = ISxy?=3x5xxxyxy
Both terms have 5, x and y as common factors.
Hence 5x*y—ISxy> = S*xxxxy-—3x5 xxxyxy

5 *x xy (x-3y)

Sxy (x-3y)

Example 12.4 Factorise : 14x*y? + 10x’y + 8xy?
Solution : We know 14x’y? = 2*7*x*x xy xy
l0xXxy = 2x 5xxxx xy
8xy? 2x*2xX2xxxyxy
Therefore, 14x*y? + 10x*y + 8xy?

2*7xXx*xXyxyt2ZxSxxxxxyt
2x2ZXZX "KY KY

= 2XxxyX(7%XxxXyF5Xxt2*2xYy)
Here three terms have 2, x and y as common irreducible factors.

= 2xy (7xy + 5x + 4y)

Example 12.5 Factorise : 4x7+ 9x + 18
Solution : Here 4x7 =2*2*xxx, 92x=3*%3xxand 18=2«3 x3
We observe that there is no common term in the given three terms:
In such cases, 1 is the common factor and the given expression will be written as it is,
Hence 4x? + 9x + 18 = 2*x2xXxxx+3x*x3x%x+2%3x3
LQ@x2xxxx+3*x3xx+2x3x3)
= 4x? + 9x + 18

a braic expression if there is no common factor among the
terms. J
Example 12.6 Factorise the following:

(i) 3a (x+ y)—Sb (x+y) (ii) Ax-yP +5 (K-y)
(iii) 6x (2a — 3b) — Sy (3b — 2a)
Solution : (i) We have, 3a (x + y) —5b (x + y)
Observe that, we have two terms 3a (x + y) and 5b (x + y)
Clearly, (x + y) is a common factor among them
Hence, 3a (x + y) — 5b (x + y) = (x + y) (3a— 5b)
(ii) We have, 2(x — y? + 5 (x-y)
Here, we have two terms 2(x — y)’ and 5 (x — y).
Clearly (x~y) is a common factor among them
Hence, 2 (x—y) +5 (x—y)=(x—y) [2 (x—y) +4] = (x—y) (2x—2y + 5)
(iii) We have, 6x (2a—3b) —Sy (3b — 2a)
Rewrite second term —Sy (3b — 2a) = —Sy [-(2a — 3b)]

= 5y (2a — 3b)
Hence, 6x (2a — 3b) —Sy (3b — 2a) = 6x (2a —3b) + Sy (2a —3b)
= (2a — 3b) (6x+5y). (Taking common (2a —3b))

12.3.2 Factorisation by Regrouping Terms

In last section, we have discussed the method of finding common factors in which given alge-
braic expressions have common factors. But sometimes, we have such algebraic expressions which
cannot be factorised directly that can be factorised by regrouping terms. We shall discuss such
factorisation as follows:

Consider the expression 3x + 3 + 4xy + 4y

Here you can notice that no factor is common to all the terms but first two terms have common
factor 3 and the last two terms have common factors 4 and y. So in this type of sums, we regroup
the tems on follows:

In this case, we write (3x + 3) and (4xy + 4y)

3x+3 = 3xxt+3x1
3.x (x+ 1)
4xxxy+4xy
4xxxyt4xyxl
4y (x + 1)
Hence 3x + 3 + 4xy + 4y = (3x +3) + (4xy + 4y) = 3 (x+1) + 4y (x+1)

Now here we have two terms

Observe, we have common factor (x+1) in both terms. Combining these two terms.

3x+3+4xyt+4y =3 (x+ 1) + 4y (x+ D=(x+1) 3 +4y)

Thus, The algebraic expression 3x + 3 + 4xy + 4y is now in the form of a product of two
irreducible factors.

Hence (x+1) and (3+4y) are the factors of 3x + 3 + 4xy + 4y.

Suppose that the above expression was given as 3x + 4y + 4xy + 3 ; Then it may not be easy
to factorise directly. For that we have to rearrange the terms after observing.

Rearranging the expression as 3x + 3 + 4xy +4y allows us to form groups (3x+3) and (4xy

+4y) leading to factorisation. This process is called regrouping. Regrouping may be possible in more
than one way. Suppose, we can regroup the expression as 3x + 4xy + 3 + 4y.

Now 3x+4xy+3+4y =(3x+4xy)+(3+4y)

=x (3 + 4y) + 1«(3 + 4y)
= (3 + 4y) (x +1)

The factors are the same, although they appear in different order.

Example 12.7. Factorise the following expressions.

and 4xy + 4y

I

(i) Sxy +7y — 5x*- 7x (ii) ax —ay + bx — by
(iii) 5p*— Spq — 10p + 16q
Solution : (i) Step I. Check if there is a common factor among all terms. Here, we have no
common factor,

Step IL Observe that the first two terms have a common factor y:
i.e, Sxy + Ty = y(Sxt7) ....... (1)

Now, observe that in last two terms, there is ‘—x” as a common factor.
—5x? — 7x = -—x (5x47) -....,.-: (2)
putting (1) & (2) together, we have
Sxy + Ty — 5x?-—7x = y(5x+7)-—x(5x+7)

12.3.3 Factorisation using Algebraic Identities

Tn last section, we have learnt about the factorisation of algebraic expressions using common
factors method and regrouping method, In this section, we shall discuss the factorisation using alge-
braic identities.

We know that

@) (a+b)? =a?+2ab + b?............ @ (ii) (a—b)? =a? —2ab+ Bean, (0)

@ii) (a+b) (a-—b) =a —bB (i)

When the given expression is in the form of a?+ 2ab + b? or a? — 2ab + b? or a? — b? then it
can be converted in the form of (a + b)?, (a — b)* or (a — b) (a + b) respectively. then it can be
factorised by using above identity. The following examples illustrate it.

Example 12.8. Factorise :
(i) x*+10x+25 = (ii) y’-— 6y +9 (iii) 25m* +30m +9
(iv) 9p? —24p + 16 (v) p* + 2p*q’ + qt
Solution : Given expression has three terms, therefore it does not fit identity (iii), Here two

terms ie. first and third terms are perfect squares with positive sign so it is of the
form a? + 2ab + b? or a? — 2ab + b?

(i) We have , x? + 10x +25 =x? + 10x+ 3
First and third terms are perfect squares in form of a” and b? (where a =x, b = 5)
and middle term is in the form of Zab =2 (x) (5)

Page_Number 239 started
x2 + 10x + 25 = x2 + 2(x) (5) +
Thus x? + 10x +5=(x+5) [~ a? + 2ab + b? = (atb)’]
(ii) We have, y? — 6y + 9 = y? — 6y + 3?
Here, First and third terms are perfect squares in form of a” and b? where a= y, b=3
and middle term is in form of 2ab = 2 (y) (3)
y?— 6y +3? =y? -2 (y) G) +3?

Thus y? — 6y +9 =(y-3) [a2 — ab +b? = (a— by’
(ii) 25m? + 30m + 9 = 5¢m? + 30m + 3?
= (5m)? + 30m + (3) [Here a = 5m, b = 3]
= (5m)? + 2(5m) (3) + 3)? = Gm+3)?
Thus, 25m? + 30m + 9 = (5m +3}
(vy) 9p? —24p + 16 = 3%p? — 2d4p + 4?
= (3p) — 24p + 4 [Here a = 3p, b = 4]
= (3p)? — 2p) (4) + 4?= Gp - 47
Thus, 9p?— 24p + 16 = (3p — 4)
(v)We have, p* + 2p? q’ + q* = (p’? + 2p’q? + (q?P

= (p*¥ + 2(p)’ (q’) + @’P
= (p? + q’)
Thus, p* + 2pq? + q* =('+qP

(i) a®25 (ii) 4x°-9 (iii) 49x°-36y? (iv) aey “ oy

(v) 16x5 — 144°
Solution : Given expressions has two terms, both are perfect squares with second term is
negative. So these are of form a’— b? = (a—b) (a+b)
(i) a2-25 = aS? = (a — 5) (a + 5)
(i) 4x2=- 9 = 22x? — 3? = (2x)?— 34. = (2x — 3) (2x + 3)
(iil) 49x? — 36y? = 7?x? — 6*y? = (7x)? — (6y)? = (7x — 6y) (7x + by)

12.3.4 FACTORS OF THE FORM (x+a) (x+b)

In last section, we have leat the factorization of algebraic expressions using algebraic identities, In this
section, we shall discuss such type of algebraic expression which are in the form of x?+ fx + mie. which
does not contain two perfect square terms, Let us discuss how we factorise such expressions,

For factorising an algebraic expression of the type x’ + #x + m, we use identity x? + (a+b) x+ ab
=(x +a) (x +b). For this we find two factors a and b of m (i.e. the constant term) such that

ab=manda+b=£
ie. Sum of both factors = Coefficient of x and Product of both factors = Constant term
Example 12.12. Factorise : x7 + 14x + 33
Solution : StepI Find the two numbers whose product is constant term (i.e. 33) and
sum is the coeflicient of x (ie. 14)

Step II. Since the product is positive. Therefore
both factors of 33 will be either positive or
negative.

Step III, But the sum is positive so both factors
of 33 will be positive.

Step IV. Factors of 33 are 1*33, 3*11 one pair from above factors is taken
whose sum is 14 i.e. 3 & 11,

Therefore the required numbers are 3 & 11

x?+ 14x +33. =x?+ (3 +11) x+33

=(x+3)(x+11) | Byusing identity
x? + (atb) x +:ab = (x + a) (x +b)

Example 12.13. Factorise : x’— 5x + 6
Solution : We want to find two numbers (integers) whose sum is —5 and
product is 6, Here sum is negative, therefore, both factors of 6

will be negative, i.e. 6 = (—1) « (—6) or (-2) = (3) Product = 6

required factor of 6 are (~2) and (—3). 1x6 | (1) * (4)

Therefore x?— 5x +6 =x? + {(-2) + (-3)} x + (2)(-3) 72 * 3 | C2) * CA)

= (x-2) (x-3)
Example 12.14 Factorise : p?>+ 4p — 12
Solution : We find two numbers whose product is (—12) and sum is 4.

Since product is negative, one number will be positive and the other number will be

negative.

and the sumiis positive, so numerically greater of two numbers will be positive. So

the required factors are 6 and (—2),

Therefore  p?+4p—12 = p?+{6+(-2)}p-12
p?+ 6p — 2p — 12 (-1) * 12]1* (-12)
p (p + 6) — 2 (p + 6) (2) x 6 |2 x (4)
(p + 6) (p — 2)

Product = 33

Example 12.15 Factorise ; y?— 4y — 45

Solution :

We want to find two numbers whose product is (~45) and sum is (-4)
Since the product is negative therefore one of numbers is positive and the other
number is negative.
Since sum is negative, therefore. numerically greater of two numbers is negative,
So, the required number are (—9) and 5.
y’—4y-45 = y?+(-9+5)y-45 Product = —45

12.4 Division of Algebraic Expressions
We have learnt about addition, subtraction and nuultiplication of algebraic expressions. Now, we
will learn how to divide one algebraic expression by another. We know that division is the inverse
operation of multiplication. Thus 7 = 5= 35.

gives 35+5=7 or a9 7=5
Similarly (i) 4x x 3x? = 12x!
Therefore 12x3+ 4x = 3x?
Or 12x? + 3x? = 4x
(ii) 3x (x + 2) = 3x? + 6x
Therefore (3x? + 6x) +3x=x+2
Or (3x? + 6x) + (x + 2) = 3x

Now we shall learn how the division of one expression can be done by another expression.
12.4.1 Division of a monomial by another Monomial :
In this section, we shall learn the division of a monomial by another monomial.

Consider 12x3+ 3x
We may write 3x and 12x? in irreducible factors.
3x = 3x*x
and 1280 = 2% 2x3*x*xxx
Or 1230 = 3Xxx2x2xxxx (Here seperate 3x from
= (3x) » (4x) factors of 12x°)

Therefore, 12x3 + 3x= 4x?
This process is tedious and time consuming, so there is a shorter way by cancellation of
common factors like we do in division of numbers.

Consider the division of a polynomial 6a? + 8a’ + 4a by a monomial 2a. We shall factorise first

ie. 6a} + 8a* + 4a = 2a (3a? + 4a + 2)
2a(3a? +4a +2)
(6a3 + 8a? + 4a)+2a = —=,
= 3a?+4a+2
We can divide it without making factors i.e. directly as follows:
i 2
(6a3 4 8a2 4 4a) wr 2a= 6a + Bai + 4a
2a (Divide each term by
6a? 8a? 48 the given monomial)

Example 12.20. Divide as directed :
(i) (Sp? — 25p + 20) + (p-1) (ii) 12xy (9x? — 16y") + 4xy (3x + 4y)
Solution : (i) First factorise (5p? — 25p + 20), We get

Now,

Sp?— 25p+20 =S(p?—5p+4)=5 (p?-—4p-—p+4)
=5 [p (p- 4) -1 (P4)] = 5 @ 4) (P1)

Let us learn another method of division of polynoments.
Example 12.21.Divide (3 — 11x + 6x?) by (1 + 3x)
Write the dividend & divisor in decreasing order of powers of variable.

Solution :

Step 1.

Step 2.

Step 3.

Step 4.

Step 5.

Dividend: 6x? — 11x + 3
Divisor : 3x—1
Divide the first term of dividend i.e. 6x? by the first term of divisor 3x, we
oS Se 3x-1)6x'— 11x > 3
i.e. We get first term of quotient as 2x.
Multiply the divisor (3x—1) by 2x (Resulting expression of step 2)
2x

if) == Gyt -
We get 2x (3x—1) 6x? — 2x 3x-I)6x'—lIx> 3
Subtract this from dividend (6x? — 11x +3) 6x" — 2x
to get remainder (6x? — 11x + 3) — (6x? — 2x) =—-9x +3 =9x+3
Now consider this remainder ~9x + 3 as new dividend. Divide the first term
of new dividend (—9x) by first term of divisor 3x. 2x —3
3x1) 6x: — I1x+3

6x"

9x
We get —— =-3 (As instep 2) 2x

3x is
ie. 2nd term of quotient. —9x+3
Multiply the divisor (3x—1) by —3 (Resulting expression of step

4) 2x -3

We get —3 (3x-1) =-9x + 3. 3x-1) 6x) — 11x +3
Subtract this from new dividend to get remainder _& + 2x
[(-9x+3) — (9x + 3)] 9x +3

In this shigisn you 1 will learn:

* To read and interpret data from different types of graphs, used in
daily life.

* To understand the trends and compare the information given in
graphs.

* To understand the concept of x-axis, Y-axis, origin, etc. in cartesian
coordinate system.

* To plot points on the plane and read coordinates of a point from a
aph.

13.1 Intreduction:-

The graphs are visual representation of collected data. We can represent a data in tabular form
but graphical represtation of the data is easier to understand. We have seen graphs in newspapers,
on television, magazines, books etc. The purpose of the graph is to show numerical facts in visual
form for understanding quickly, easily and clearly. We have already discussed many graphs like Bar
Graph, Histogram and Pie Chart in previous chapter ‘DATA HANDLING’.

Tn this chapter, we shall discuss ‘line graph’ in detail.

13.2 Linear Graph

Aline graph consists of bits of line segments joined consecutively. Some times the graph may be
a whole unbroken line. Such a graph is called a linear
graph.

To draw such a line we need to locate some points
on the graph sheet. In this section We will lear to lo-
cate points on a graph sheet and plot the points on graph
sheet,

13.2.1 Location of a Point : To locate a point ona
plane, two observations are required. First,
How far it is from the left edge (Vertical line)
of the plane and second. how far it is from the
horizontal line in the plane.

The 17th century mathematician Rene Descartes noticed the move-
ments of an insect near a corner of the ceiling and began to think of
determining the position of a given point in a plane, His svstem of

fixing a point with the help of two measurement horizontal and ver-
tical came to known as cartesian system in his honour:

13.2.2 Co-ordinates : Suppose you go to a Cinema Hall and search for your reserved seat. You
need two numbers. the row numbers and the seat. This is the basic method for fixing a
point in the plane.

To find the position of a point on a graph sheet we draw two axes (like left edge and bottom
edge) The horizontal line is known as x-axis and vertical line is known as y-axis. The point of
intersection of x-axis and y-axis is called origin having coordinates (0,0). The graph sheet
itself is a square grid. Now observe in the figure how the point (3, 4) which is 3 units
from y-axis and 4 units from x-axis is plotted on the graph.

The x-coordinate 3 is called abscissa and the y-co-ordinate 4 is called ordinate of the pomt.

Se

Figure 13.2

We say that the co-ordinates of the point are (3, 4)
Example 13.1 From the figure choose the letter that indicates the location of the points
given below.

13.4 Drawing a Graph

In Last section we have discussed the study of line Graph. In this section we shall learn the
construction of line Graph. Here we will discuss the line Graph of variables having direct proportion.

We have learnt about the direct proportion, where increase/decrease in one quantity, changes
the other quantity in same ratio for example if we use more electricity, the bill will be more.
Similarly if we want to travel more miles, more fuel is required. So, Amount of electricity bill
depends upon the quantity of electricity used. We say that quantity of electricity is an indepen-
dent variable (or sometimes control variable) and the amount of electric bill is dependent vari-
able. The relation between such variables can be shown through a graph.

Working Rule:

1, Take an independent variable (abscissa) along x-axis and the dependent variable (ordinate)

Example 13.8 The following table shows the quantity of petrol and its cost
No. of litres of petrol |1_| 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 |
Cost ofpetroting | 70_| 350__| 700 |1050_| 1400

Plot a graph to show the data

Figure 13.19
Sol. () Letus take a suitable scale on both axes

(ii) | Mark number of litres along the horizontal (x-axis)
(ii) | Mark cost of petrol along the vertical axis (y-axis)
(tv) Plot the points
(v) Join the points

We find that the graph is a line (It is a linear graph). It passes through origin because for
zero litre petrol, cost will be zero.

Example 13.9 Draw the graph for the values given in the table, with suitable scale on the
axes

Weight of aples (imkg) [1 | 2 | 5 | 7 | 10 |
[Cost ine | 60 | 120 | 300 [420 |6o0 |

From the graph find the cost of 6kg and 8kg apples.

Figure 13.20
(i) Let us take suitable scale on both the axis (fig 15.20)
(i) Mark weight of apples along x-axis
(ii) Mark cost of apples along y-axis
(iv) Plot the points (1, 60) ; (2, 120) ; (5 300) (7, 420) ; (10, 600)
(v) Join the Points we find that graph is a line.
From graph we can see that cost of 6kg of apples is 2360 and cost of 8kg of apples is
2480.

Example 13.10 : Gurpreet can ride a motorcycle with a uniform speed of 40 km/hr. Draw a
time-distance graph for this and from graph find (a) time taken by Gurpreet to
ride 100 km (b) The distance covered in 8 hours,

Sol. If Gurpreetis travelling with a unifirm speed of 40 knw/hr, ftom this we can make the following table.

2 * 40 = 80km
3 = 40 = 120km
4x 40 = 160km

Fine taiousy [1 [2 ]3 [4]
Distance covered Gay | 40 | 80 [120 |160 |
Now

(i) Let us take a suitable scale on axes (fig 15.21).
(it) Mark time along x-axis

(iii) Mark distance travelled along y-axis

(iv) Plot the point (1, 40) (2, 80) (3, 120) (4, 160)

Now sure

(a) Time taken by Gurpreet to ride 100km: For 100km on y-axis, we get the
corresponding time of 2.5 hours on horizontal axis. So required, time to cover a
distance of 100km is 2.5 hours.

(b) Corresponding to 8 hours on x-axis there is 320km on y-axis

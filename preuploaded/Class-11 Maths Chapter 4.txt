4.1 Introduction

In earlier classes, we have studied linear equations in one
and two variables and quadratic equations in one variable.
We have seen that the equation x° + 1 = 0 has no real
solution as x* + 1 = 0 gives x° =— 1 and square of every
real number is non-negative. So, we need to extend the
real number system to a larger system so that we can
find the solution of the equation x? =— 1. In fact, the main
objective is to solve the equation ax? + bx + c= 0, where
D=b* — 4ac <0, which is not possible in the system of
real numbers.

W. R. Hamilton
4.2 Complex Numbers (1805-1865)

Let us denote ./—] by the symbol i. Then, we have i? =-1, This means that i is a
solution of the equation x? + 1 = 0.
A number of the form a + ib, where a and b are real numbers, is defined to be a

(-l
complex number. For example, 2 + 3, (—1) + i3 4+i [= are complex numbers.

For the complex number z = a + ib, a is called the real part, denoted by Re z and
bis called the imaginary part denoted by Im z of the complex number z. For example,
ifz=2+i5, then Rez=2 andImz=5S.

Two complex numbers z, = a + ib and z, = c + id are equal if a=c and b=d.

Example | If 4x + i(3x —y) = 3 +i (— 6), where x and y are real numbers, then find
the values of x and y.

Solution We have
4x +i (3x-—y)=3 +i (-6) . (1)
Equating the real and the imaginary parts of (1), we get
4x = 3, 3x-y=-6,
: . . 3 33
which, on solving simultaneously, give * = 4 and y= re
4.3 Algebra of Complex Numbers
In this Section, we shall develop the algebra of complex numbers.

4.3.1 Addition of two complex numbers Let z, = a+ ib and z, = c + id be any two
complex numbers. Then, the sum z, + z, is defined as follows:
z,+2,=(a+c)+i(b +d), which is again a complex number.
For example, (2 + 73) + (— 6 +75) = (2-6) +i (3 +5)=—-4+78
The addition of complex numbers satisfy the following properties:

(i) The closure law The sum of two complex numbers is a complex
number, i.e., z, + Z, is a complex number for all complex numbers
z, and z,.

(ii) The commutative law For any two complex numbers z, and z,,
Z, 42,5242,

(iii) The associative law For any three complex numbers z,, z
(2, +2,)+2,=2,+ (,+2,).

(iv) The existence of additive identity There exists the complex number
0 + i 0 (denoted as 0), called the additive identity or the zero complex
number, such that, for every complex number z, z + 0 =z.

(v) The existence of additive inverse To every complex number
z=a+ ib, we have the complex number — a + i(— 5) (denoted as — z),
called the additive inverse or negative of z. We observe that z + (-z) = 0
(the additive identity).

4.3.2. Difference of two complex numbers Given any two complex numbers z, and
z,, the difference z, —z, is defined as follows:

Z,-2Z,=2,+(-2).
For example, (6 + 3i)—- (2-1) = (6+ 31) +(—2 +1) =4+4i
and (2— i)-(6+ 31) =(2-i) + (- 6-31) =—-4-4i

4.3.3 Multiplication of two complex numbers Let z,= a + ib and z, = c + id be any
two complex numbers. Then, the product z, z, is defined as follows:

Z, 2, = (ac — bd) + i(ad + be)

For example, (3 + 75) (2 + 16) = (3 x 2—5 x 6) + i(3 x 6 +5 x 2) =— 24 + 128

for every complex number z.

In general, for any integer k, = 1, i *' =i, M4? =—-1, M3 =-7

4.3.6 The square roots of a negative realnumber

Note that ? =-l and (-iP=?=-1

Therefore, the square roots of — | are i, i. However, by the symbol ./-7 , we would
mean i only.

Now, we can see that i and —7 both are the solutions of the equation x* + 1 = 0 or
e=-l,

Similarly (Vi) =(v3) P=3(-1)=-3

Therefore, the square roots of —3 are V3 i and -3 i.
Again, the symbol ./—3 is meant to represent V3i only, i.e., —3 = J3i.

Generally, if.a is a positive real number, J—-a = Ja V-1 = Ja i,

We already know that Jax Jb = Jab for all positive real number a and b. This

result also holds true when either a>0,b<0 ora<0, b> 0. What ifa<0,b<0?

Let us examine.

? =J-1 V-1=,/(-1) (-1) (by assuming fax Jé = Jab for all real numbers)
= vi = 1, which is a contradiction to the fact that i? =-1,
Therefore, fa x./b #Jab if both a and b are negative real numbers.

Further, if any of a and b is zero, then, clearly, Vax vb = Jab = 0.
4.3.7 Identities We prove the following identity

2
(z, + Z) = Zz + Zz + 2z,Z,, for all complex numbers z, and z,.

Proof We have, (z, + z,) = (2, + 2,) @, + 2,),

Similarly, we can prove the following identities:
. 2
(i) (2,-2,) =z) -22z, 2 +23

(i) (2.42) =2) +32; 2, +3225 +23

to be true for all complex numbers.

4.4 The Modulus and the Conjugate of a Complex Number

Let z= a+ib be acomplex number. Then, the modulus of z, denoted by | z |, is defined

to be the non-negative real number ./q? +h? ,i.e.,|z|= Va? +5? and the conjugate

of z, denoted as 7, is the complex number a — ib, i.e., 7 =a— ib.
For example, |3+7[=v3? +P = -10, lan 5° =/29,

and 34i=3-7, 2-5i=245i, 3j=5 =3i-

Observe that the multiplicative inverse of the non-zero complex number z is
given by

1 a . —b a-ib Zz
hs 7 = 93 tI = a = 2
at+ib a+b a+b a+b |z|
_ 2
or zz=|2|

4.5 Argand Plane and Polar Representation

We already know that corresponding to
each ordered pair of real numbers
(x, y), we get a unique point in the XY-
plane and vice-versa with reference to a
set of mutually perpendicular lines known
as the x-axis and the y-axis. The complex
number x + iy which corresponds to the
ordered pair (x, y) can be represented
geometrically as the unique point P(x, y)
in the XY-plane and vice-versa.

Some complex numbers such as
2+4i,-2+3i,0+ 1i,2+0i,-5—2iand
1 — 2i which correspond to the ordered
pairs (2, 4), ( — 2, 3), (0, 1), (2, 0), (-5, -2), and (1, — 2), respectively, have been
represented geometrically by the points A, B, C, D, E, and F, respectively in
the Fig 4.1.

The plane having a complex number assigned to each of its point is called the

Fig 4.1

complex plane or the Argand plane.

Obviously, in the Argand plane, the modulus of the complex number

xt+iy =x? + y? is the distance between the point P(x, y) and the origin O (0, 0)

(Fig 4.2). The points on the x-axis corresponds to the complex numbers of the form
a+i0 and the points on the y-axis corresponds to the complex numbers of the form

and the imaginary axis.
The representation of a complex number z = x + iy and its conjugate
z =x -—iy in the Argand plane are, respectively, the points P (x, y) and Q (x, —y).
Geometrically, the point (x, —y) is the mirror image of the point (x, y) on the real
axis (Fig 4.3).

Historical Note

The fact that square root of a negative number does not exist in the real number
system was recognised by the Greeks. But the credit goes to the Indian
mathematician Mahavira (850) who first stated this difficulty clearly. “He
mentions in his work ‘Ganitasara Sangraha’ as in the nature of things a negative
(quantity) is not a square (quantity)’, it has, therefore, no square root’.
Bhaskara, another Indian mathematician, also writes in his work Bijaganita,
written in 1150. “There is no square root of a negative quantity, for it is nota
square.” Cardan (1545) considered the problem of solving

x+y=10, xy = 40.

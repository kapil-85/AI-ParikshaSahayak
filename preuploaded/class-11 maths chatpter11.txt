11.1 Introduction

You may recall that to locate the position of a point in a
plane, we need two intersecting mutually perpendicular lines
in the plane. These lines are called the coordinate axes
and the two numbers are called the coordinates of the
point with respect to the axes. In actual life, we do not
have to deal with points lying in a plane only. For example,
consider the position of a ball thrown in space at different
points of time or the position of an aeroplane as it flies
from one place to another at different times during its flight.

Similarly, if we were to locate the position of the
lowest tip of an electric bulb hanging from the ceiling of a

Leonhard Euler
(1707-1783)

room or the position of the central tip of the ceiling fan in a room, we will not only
require the perpendicular distances of the point to be located from two perpendicular
walls of the room but also the height of the point from the floor of the room. Therefore,
we need not only two but three numbers representing the perpendicular distances of
the point from three mutually perpendicular planes, namely the floor of the room and
two adjacent walls of the room. The three numbers representing the three distances
are called the coordinates of the point with reference to the three coordinate
planes. So, a point in space has three coordinates. In this Chapter, we shall study the

basic concepts of geometry in three dimensional space.*

11.2 Coordinate Axes and Coordinate Planes in Three Dimensional Space

Consider three planes intersecting at a point O
such that these three planes are mutually
perpendicular to each other (Fig 11.1). These
three planes intersect along the lines X'OX, Y'OY
and Z’OZ, called the x, y and z-axes, respectively.
We may note that these lines are mutually
perpendicular to each other. These lines constitute
the rectangular coordinate system. The planes
XOY, YOZ and ZOX, called, respectively the
XY-plane, YZ-plane and the ZX-plane, are
known as the three coordinate planes. We take Fig 11.1

the XOY plane as the plane of the paper and the

line Z'OZ as perpendicular to the plane XOY. If the plane of the paper is considered
as horizontal, then the line Z'OZ will be vertical. The distances measured from
XY-plane upwards in the direction of OZ are taken as positive and those measured
downwards in the direction of OZ’ are taken as negative. Similarly, the distance
measured to the right of ZX-plane along OY are taken as positive, to the left of
ZX-plane and along OY’ as negative, in front of the YZ-plane along OX as positive
and to the back of it along OX" as negative. The point O is called the origin of the
coordinate system. The three coordinate planes divide the space into eight parts known
as octants. These octants could be named as XOYZ, X'OYZ, X'OY'Z, XOY'Z, XOYZ’,
X'OYZ’, X'OY'Z' and XOY'Z’. and denoted by I, II, II, ..., VII , respectively.

11.3 Coordinates of a Point in Space Z P(x,y,z)
A

Having chosen a fixed coordinate system in the :
space, consisting of coordinate axes, coordinate :
planes and the origin, we now explain, as to how,
given a point in the space, we associate with it three
coordinates (x,y,z) and conversely, given a triplet
of three numbers (x, y, z), how, we locate a point in

the space.
Given a point P in space, we drop a X ( y, 0)
perpendicular PM on the XY-plane with M as the Fig 11.2

foot of this perpendicular (Fig 11.2). Then, from the point M, we draw a perpendicular
ML to the x-axis, meeting it at L. Let OL be x, LM be y and MP bez. Then x,y andz
are called the x, y and z coordinates, respectively, of the point P in the space. In
Fig 11.2, we may note that the point P (x, y, z) lies in the octant XOYZ and so all x, y,
z are positive. If P was in any other octant, the signs of x, y and z would change

accordingly. Thus, to each point P in the space there corresponds an ordered triplet
(x, y, z) of real numbers.

Conversely, given any triplet (x, y, z), we would first fix the point L on the x-axis
corresponding to x, then locate the point M in the XY-plane such that (x, y) are the
coordinates of the point M in the XY-plane. Note that LM is perpendicular to the
x-axis or is parallel to the y-axis. Having reached the point M, we draw a perpendicular
MP to the XY-plane and locate on it the point P corresponding to z. The point P so
obtained has then the coordinates (x, y, z). Thus, there is a one to one correspondence
between the points in space and ordered triplet (x, y, z) of real numbers.

Alternatively, through the point P in the
space, we draw three planes parallel to the
coordinate planes, meeting the x-axis, y-axis
and z-axis in the points A, B and C, respectively
(Fig 11.3). Let OA = x, OB = y and OC =z.
Then, the point P will have the coordinates x, y
and z and we write P (x, y, z). Conversely, given
x,y and z, we locate the three points A, B and
C on the three coordinate axes. Through the
points A, B and C we draw planes parallel to
the YZ-plane, ZX-plane and XY-plane, x Fig 11.3
respectively. The point of interesection of these three planes, namely, ADPF, BDPE
and CEPF is obviously the point P, corresponding to the ordered triplet (x, y, z). We
observe that if P (x, y, z) is any point in the space, then x, y and z are perpendicular
distances from YZ, ZX and XY planes, respectively.

[== Note]The coordinates of the origin O are (0,0,0). The coordinates of any point
on the x-axis will be as (x,0,0) and the coordinates of any point in the YZ-plane will
be as (0, y, z).

Remark The sign of the coordinates of a point determine the octant in which the

point lies. The following table shows the signs of the coordinates in eight octants.

Example 1 In Fig 11.3, if P is (2,4,5), find the coordinates of F.

Solution For the point F, the distance measured along OY is zero. Therefore, the
coordinates of F are (2,0,5).

Example 2 Find the octant in which the points (—3,1,2) and (-3,1,— 2) lie.

Solution From the Table 11.1, the point (3,1, 2) lies in second octant and the point

(-3, 1, — 2) lies in octant VI.

(3, -1, 6) (2, — 4, -7).

11.4 Distance between Two Points

We have studied about the distance
between two points in two-dimensional
coordinate system. Let us now extend this
study to three-dimensional system.

Let P(x,, y,, z,) and Q (x, ¥,, 2,)
be two points referred to a system of
rectangular axes OX, OY and OZ.
Through the points P and Q draw planes
parallel to the coordinate planes so as to
form a rectangular parallelopiped with one
diagonal PQ (Fig 11.4).

Now, since ZPAQ is a right x
angle, it follows that, in triangle PAQ,

PQ? = PA? + AQ? w (1)
Also, triangle ANQ is right angle triangle with ZANQ a right angle.

Fig 11.4

212 MATHEMATICS

Therefore AQ = AN? + NQ? w. (2)
From (1) and (2), we have

PQ? = PA?+ AN? + N@

Now PA=y,—y, AN =x, —x, and NQ=z,~-z,
Hence PO = (x, - x, + 0, -y) + (z,-2,)
Therefore PQ= Vena, 40-9, PH2.-2,)7

This gives us the distance between two points (x,, y,, 2,) and (x,, y,, Z,).

In particular, if x, =, =z, = 0, ie., point P is origin O, then OQ = x,’+y,°+z,°
which gives the distance between the origin O and any point Q (x,, y,, Z,)-
Example 3 Find the distance between the points P(1, —3, 4) and Q (—4, 1, 2).
Solution The distance PQ between the points P (1,—3, 4) and Q (—4, 1, 2) is

PQ= f(-4-1?+ 0+3)?+ (2-47
= |%5a16+4
= 45 = 35 units
Example 4 Show that the points P (2, 3, 5), Q (1, 2, 3) and R (7, 0, —1) are collinear.

Solution We know that points are said to be collinear if they lie on a line.
Now, — PQ= f(1+2)?+ (2-3)? 3-5)? = 94144 = V4

QR = (7=1)?+ O-2)?+ 1-3)? = ¥3644416 = V56 =2V14

and PR = (7 +2)?+ (0-3)?+ (-I-5)? = V814+9+36 = V126 = 3V14
Thus, PQ + QR = PR. Hence, P, Q and R are collinear.

Example 5 Are the points A (3, 6, 9), B (10, 20, 30) and C (25, — 41, 5), the vertices
of a right angled triangle?

Solution By the distance formula, we have
AB? =(10—3/+ (20-6) + 30-9/
=49+ 196 +441 =686
BC? =(25-10¥ +(—41 —20/ + (5-307
=225 +3721 + 625=4571

CA? = (3-257 + (6+ 41) +(9-5/P
= 484 + 2209 + 16 =2709
We find that CA? + AB’? # BC’.
Hence, the triangle ABC is not a right angled triangle.
Example 6 Find the equation of set of points P such that PA? + PB? = 2k’, where
A and B are the points (3, 4, 5) and (—1, 3, —7), respectively.
Solution Let the coordinates of point P be (x, y, z).
Here PA? =(x-39 + (v- 4) +(2z-5P
PB = (x + 1P +(y—-3P + (2+ 7P
By the given condition PA? + PB? = 2k’, we have
(x-3P + (vy—4Y + (2 -5P ++ 1)? + Y—-3P t+ (2 + TP = 2K

ie, 2x? + 2y? + 22° — 4x — 14y + 42 = 2k — 109.

EXERCISE 12

1. Find the distance between the following pairs of points:
G@) (2,3, 5) and (4, 3, 1) (i) (-3, 7, 2) and (2, 4, —-1)
ii) (—1, 3, — 4) and (1, -3, 4) (iv) (2, —-I, 3) and (2, 1, 3).
Show that the points (—2, 3, 5), (1, 2, 3) and (7, 0, —1) are collinear.
3. Verify the following:
Gi) (0,7,-10), (1, 6, — 6) and (4, 9, — 6) are the vertices of an isosceles triangle.
Gi) (0,7, 10), (1, 6, 6) and (—4, 9, 6) are the vertices ofa right angled triangle.
(ii) (-1, 2, 1), (1, -2, 5), (4, -7, 8) and (2, —3, 4) are the vertices ofa parallelogram.

4. Find the equation of the set of points which are equidistant from the points
(, 2, 3) and (3, 2,-1).

5. Find the equation of the set of points P, the sum of whose distances from
A (4, 0, 0) and B (— 4, 0, 0) is equal to 10.

Miscellaneous Examples

Example 7 Show that the points A (1, 2, 3), B (-1, -2, -1), C (2, 3, 2) and
D (4, 7, 6) are the vertices of a parallelogram ABCD, but it is not a rectangle.

Solution To show ABCD is a parallelogram we need to show opposite side are equal
Note that.

AB = y(-1-1)?+(-2-2)°+(-1-3) = f4+16 +16 =6
BC = f(2+1)?43+2)?+(2+1? = 942549 = Ja3
CD = J(4—2)?+(7-3)?+(6-2)? = J4+16+16 =6
DA = f0=4)+(2-77+3—6)? = ¥942549=/43

Since AB = CD and BC = AD, ABCD is a parallelogram.

Now, it is required to prove that ABCD is not a rectangle. For this, we show that
diagonals AC and BD are unequal. We have

AC = J(2-1?+G-2)?+(2-3)? = VI+141=v3
BD = J(441)2+(7+2)°+(641? = /25+81+49=,/155.

Since AC # BD, ABCD is not a rectangle.

We can also show that ABCD is a parallelogram, using the property that
diagonals AC and BD bisect each other.

Example 8 Find the equation of the set of the points P such that its distances from the
points A (3, 4, -5) and B (— 2, 1, 4) are equal.

Solution If P (x, y, z) be any point such that PA = PB.

Now (x-3)?+ (y—4)°+ (245)? = J(x+2)?+ (v—D?+ (2-47
or = (x-3)? +(y-4)? #(24 5) = (x +2) +(y-1)? + (2 -4)”
or 10X+ 6y— 18z 29 =0.

Example 9 The centroid of a triangle ABC is at the point (1, 1, 1). If the coordinates
of A and B are (3, —5, 7) and (-1, 7, — 6), respectively, find the coordinates of the
point C.

Solution Let the coordinates of C be (x, y, z) and the coordinates of the centroid G be
(1, 1, 1). Then

Summary

® In three dimensions, the coordinate axes of a rectangular Cartesian coordi-
nate system are three mutually perpendicular lines. The axes are called the x,
y and z-axes.

® The three planes determined by the pair of axes are the coordinate planes,
called XY, YZ and ZX-planes.

© The three coordinate planes divide the space into eight parts known as octants.

® The coordinates of a point P in three dimensional geometry is always written
in the form of triplet like (x, y, z). Here x, y and z are the distances from the

YZ, ZX and XY-planes.

® (i) Any point on x-axis is of the form (x, 0, 0)
(ii) Any point on y-axis is of the form (0, y, 0)
(ii) Any point on z-axis is of the form (0, 0, z).

® Distance between two points P(x,, y,, z,) and Q (x,, y,, Z,) is given by
